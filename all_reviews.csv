The vegetable plate is also carefully selected The vegetables and ingredients are arranged beautifully when they are put into the pot. The waiter's service at the table is very considerate and friendly. The quality of vegetables, meat and seafood is naturally very good Huazhi balls and handmade shrimp paste are delicious and authentic Japanese green onion bamboo rings are delicious and have a special aroma of green onions. The last side dish to go with the porridge is the spicy dried radish which is very tasty. The set meal is quite filling. From appetizers, dishes, main meals, porridge to desserts, everything is exquisite. The overall service is also commendable Looking at the quality of the ingredients alone, I still think it’s a bit expensive. It can only be said that the pricing includes all the added value. Come and experience the quality of high-end dining. You can try it."

Great dining environment and service, very child-friendly Highly recommended, the Mother's Day set menu is very cost-effective, and the seafood and meat are both fresh. When children sit down, there are rice balls and crayons to attract their attention, allowing parents to concentrate on eating. This is a restaurant that they often come to.

食令Shabu,2025-09-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"The overall experience is pretty good. The variety of sauces ranges from refreshing quintessential soup to intense marijuana pots to meet the needs of different tastes. The meat is cut fresh and thick, it is not easy to dissolve after cooking, and the vegetables are also quite diverse, so that they are clean and sweet. What surprised me most was that the sauce area has a lot to choose from, and you can freely match your favorite taste. The attitude of the staff is kind, the cooking speed is also fast, making the meal process more enjoyable. Proportion is sufficient, the price and quality are in proportion, is worth visiting a shop."

The ingredients are fresh, and Wagyu or seafood, lobster, and crab are good choices. The service staff are friendly, and if you choose seafood, there will be tableside service to help cook it. If you go there for the first time, it is recommended to choose the 101 limited edition sea and land hot pot. The price is mid-to-high and there is almost no need to queue during weekdays."
食令Shabu,2023-10-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"The atmosphere is good~ If you want to come on your birthday, this is a good choice. If you check in, you can also get a handmade shrimp ball as a gift.

We recommend the beef short rib set meal, which is affordable, hygienic and delicious! ! !"

Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2025-09-01T00:00:00Z,Family,Arrived early before hitting the alleys of yongkang st abit later on in the day to try the famous din tai fung.. Arrived around 10:30 roughly and only had to wait in line for around 20 minutes for two people where the lines were getting busy but moving forward at a good speed. Customer service was great when arriving on 2nd floor and a quick rundown with the menu and the instructions of the best way to try the bao's from a cheat sheet at the tables. Decent extensive menu ordered from QR code at the table picked a few items not wanting to over fill our appeitites before heading on the streets again. So got the pork & chicken xinglongbaos and pork buns follwed by the pork chop fried rice to be washed down by the most delicious golden lava buns after the other meals. Baos were nice didnt stick to the surfaces so it didnt rip when pulling with chop sticks and enjoying the flavour of both the chicken and pork before using the recommended of the ginger/vinegar/soy in the ginger dish..better meats then most places but just tastes the same after a while. Pork chop fried rice was nice a real good piece of succulent porkchop on top which was delicious and the rice was good and filling with the egg mixed in alot different to our westerners fried rice we get pack home. Star of the show was the dessert tho the golden lava buns if i knew now what i did then i wish i got a couple more delicious flavour leaving a taste in my mouth wanting more thinking about it! Deffiantly must get on the menu. Great staff always busy and working at good pace around the place and always offering to refill tea when its down to the lowest in the cup.. Expensive compared to most places due to its popularity maybe even abit of a tourist trap tho a fan faviroute with the locals cost 10.017TWD Inc the 10% service charge so around &$50-53AUD at the time. Good photo spot on the 1st floor when paying watching them prepare in the window for the days servings. Probs arrive early if you want to get in quicker pending how many people.also same shop abit futther down the road offering takeout only compared to the dine in option here
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2025-03-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"We arrived at 11:30, you get a ticket and wait outside for your ticket to be called to get a seat. It was all very orderly and they have an electronic sign that displays the ticket, As we were early and only need a table for two the wait was only about 10 minutes, I noticed larger groups of people having to wait longer. The soup dumplings and crispy dumplings were excellent, thin skins with lovely pork and prawn fillings, Staff were friendly and attentive as our Chinese is limited to salutations. Service was fast and the restaurant was clean."
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2023-07-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"This Taipei 101 Din Tai Fung location was packed by the time I recieved my waitlist number and I ended up waiting 70 minutes (about the time listed on the queue). I have been to many other Din Tai Fung locations in Taipei and have ordered to-go from this location on previous visits, however this time, I wanted to dine in. My main waiter was (English name) Elvis, and his service and the rest of the staff was excellent. I left something behind anmy meal d Elvis rushed it to me while I was at the check-out. While in line, I pre-ordered and one by one, my lunch came out, and everything was delicious. Recommend to order: Xiao Long Bao, Spicy Shrimp & Pork Dumplings Drunken Chicken Since Taipei 101 is a busy destination, the wait time is long on some days but it helps you build up an appetite. I love the food here and the service makes it special. Thank you, Elvis!"
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2025-04-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Many years ago, we have been to Pan Bridge's Big Bang, we almost tried different colors, and the conclusion is that every dish is as fresh as water, whether it's a cage or a fried meal, it's all under the level, the taste of a single talk is not comparable to the street side, anyway the CP value is much higher than it, of course, the service of Big Bang is really good. Yesterday 2025/4/26 to Taipei 101, as always a lot of people are in line, we are a family dinner, but in the end, it is very disappointed, the quality of food has not changed, the price is expensive, the portion is small, the taste is good, the problem is not to eat, of course, the service of Taipei is good. Don't understand why so many guests eat fame?"
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2025-10-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Delicate soup dumplings, flavorful broth, and lightning-fast service. Lines move quickly; photo menu and open kitchen make reordering irresistible. Great for sharing and sampling multiple fillings."
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2024-03-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"We arrived at 5 pm to queue for a dinner table. Apparently we weren't early enough and we waited nearly 2 hours. Food ranged from ok to good. Not outstanding. We were ravenous so we were able to order a great variety of dishes. Must order dishes include siu long bao and beef noodles. Being a very busy restaurant, expect lots of noise and movement around you. After the long wait, our mobile phones were out of juice. We brought a charger but the restaurant refused to charge for us because there's an adapter attached to the non-Taiwanese plug. And no charging if you didn't bring your own charger. We are tourists so.... no recharging phones and no Google maps after that."
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2025-07-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Long waiting time of 80 minutes, but they were spot on. After 80 minutes we were called upon in mandarin and English. The food came fast after ordering and in portion, not all at the same time, which gave us time to eat and enjoy. Waiters were amazing, friendly and skilled. There was never a moment you yea cup was empty. Shout out to Ollie!"
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2024-08-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"We have always loved the food from DTF but this branch had upped their game by also providing a professional service in addition to great food. The person managing the crowd 30 minutes before the restaurant opens spoke Japanese to us obviously he’s bilingual, very attentive making sure we had a menu and waiting number. Once inside all other staff were same- precise and quick. Ok obviously their xiaolong bao a must but another must is the cold marinated chicken in xiaoshing wine. You will thank me later."
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2024-11-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,We ended up here because we were desperately trying to find somewhere that could do gluten free. The server that looked after us was just brilliant- great English and great knowledge of the gluten status of the menu. You can see shy the place is so busy. In fact we visited on a Thursday evening and resolved to go back in the Friday but when we arrived the queue was 55 minutes long. It was also fascinating to see all those folks making dumplings through the glass wall of the kitchen. Well worth a visit.
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2023-05-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Din Tai Fung is a Taiwanese restaurant chain most famous for its xiaolongbao (steamed pork dumplings). Although the 101 branch officially opens at 11am, the wait for a table at 10:45am is approximately 1 hour! Customers can pre-order their food online while waiting in the mall area. Servers are accommodating. Food is delivered by a meal-bot, which is very efficient. However, the poor quality definitely is not worth waiting for. Signature dishes are not impressive at all! The skin of the various xiaolongbaos is very thick and a tad bit dry. Noodles are lukewarm. The smooth and flavourful House Special Spicy Vegetable and Ground Pork Wontons (NT 180) is the only recommendable dish."
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2024-08-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"If you’re unfamiliar with the concept of their seating arrangement, it is highly recommended that you read up on this so you will at least somewhat know what to expect when you arrive at the restaurant. First off, you request to be seated then you’ll be given a ticket with a QR code. This code gives you access to their menu. It is a good idea to order ahead so that when you finally are seated, then the wait won’t take you additional time. Our wait to be seated was around 44 minutes (which they announce through a numbering system) so while waiting, we went around nearby shops. There is incidentally a grocery just around the corner, it has a lot ode range of options (local and international) of food, fresh fruits, etc. Or visit the Taipei 101 gift shop just across the waiting area. Anyway, about the food, we had the usual xiao long bao, dumpling soup, fried rice. Very good food- tasty but not salty. The soup was quite flavorful. House tea is provided free of charge. The seating area is quite expansive, but the tables are a bit close to each other that you can hear the conversations of those next to you (and vice versa). It can get quite noisy if the place is full and with each and every table with guests who are talking among their respective party. Service was quite fast and very orderly. Settling the bill is Japanese style where you pay at the front (there is a separate counter for payment). It’s a must try restaurant but prepare to wait for a long period of time especially during peak hours."
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2024-10-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"I make it a point to visit every time I return to Taiwan—the food quality remains top-notch. This time, I saw robot assistants guiding guests to their seats and delivering meals! It made me so happy!"
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2023-10-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"This a VERY popular restaurant in the lower level of Taipei 101 Tower. Despite the fact that it's quite vast inside, to avoid huge queues they have a waiting list, with numbers on a board and an estimated waiting time to be seated. When we went it was 2 hours! Our group managed to get one of their large private dining rooms, but still the wait time was 25 minutes. The food of various steamed dumplings is simply excellent - pork, chicken, fish, crab, vegetable etc + black tea + egg fried rice + soup + appetisers. The kitchen is glass-fronted/ open, so you can watch them making the thousands of littlre dumplings. Excellent food, excellent service and a real spectacle. Highly recommended."
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2025-05-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Great dim sum restaurant and all kinds of dishes from Chinese cuisine. Everything is perfect. Moderate price , the service is very professional ... maybe it lacks a smile but the staff is masked . It is a chain of restaurants there are very many throughout the city. Try it you will not be disappointed."
Din Tai Fung (Xinyi 1),2022-10-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"We had been to DingTaiFeng in a couple of its California locations, all are good. But we hear the original DTF in Taipei is the best, so here we are. Visiting Taipei for a week and this is a top must-try. We came around 4:30p and waited about 10min, not bad at all. Once we got a number we were handed the menu with order sheet so by the time we got seated it was only a few minutes and steaming XLBs arrived at our table. We ordered two steamers of pork XLB, one crab, chili sauce shrimp dumplings, spicy cucumber appetizer, and a couple of desserts. Everything was delicious! The XLB was juicy and tender, yep tasted better than CA's, specifically the pork tasted better. My favorite was the chili sauce shrimp dumplings. dumpling skin was smooth and thin, chili sauce is not overly spicy either, very flavorful. The staff was attentive, waiters and waitresses were constantly checking on our table, removing empty plates, refilling tea, taking additional orders, etc. This location has three floors, general seatings are along narrow hallway, plus private rooms for large parties. Even though space is limited, I find their process and service super efficient without making guests feel rushed. We had a delicious meal and a great experience here. If you're a XLB lover, highly recommended."
A Point Steak & Bar,2024-09-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"The steak quality is very good, the price is reasonable, and there is also the opportunity to enjoy Taipei Street View and 101 at the window location, Recommendation for those who want to enjoy steak at a reasonable price in Shinjuku District. In addition to the American Prime steak processed in a high-end Spanish oven, you can eat the main meal of dried beans, lamb beans, shrimp and more, and you can eat the double-person package!!!!"
A Point Steak & Bar,2023-10-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"The evaluation said that the French fries are delivered, the environment is okay, and the view from the window is great, but the service is very ordinary, and every waiter is very impatient. It seems that there are not enough staff? The menu says that the set drinks can be exchanged for cocktails with a discount of 50 yuan, but in fact cocktails are no longer provided. The clerk did not take the initiative to explain, and the menu did not cover up the words. I only found out after asking, which was a bit surprising... appetizers, milkshakes, Personally, I feel that the soup is not proportional to the price. I hope that the main meal of steak later will be delicious."
A Point Steak & Bar,2025-10-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"The dining experience of Ebony steak is quite pleasant, the restaurant environment is elegant and comfortable, the attitude of the service staff is friendly and professional, it is appreciated. The steak is well-maintained, the meat is fresh and juicy, and the combination of dishes and sauce adds a leveling sense. The overall meal portion is moderate, both delicious and refined. From the opening to the end of the meal, you can feel the attention of the restaurant to the details, worth a visit and recommendation again."
A Point Steak & Bar,2025-04-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"This restaurant is a great choice for celebrations and anniversaries! From the moment you enter the store, you can feel a warm and joyful atmosphere, gentle lighting and carefully arranged dining environment, so that you can immerse yourself in the pleasant feeling of celebration. The service staff is very kind and attentive, not only actively assist in taking photos, but will also carefully ask if there are special celebration needs, so that the whole meal experience is more divided! It is said that the kitchen here contains a million-level professional stoves that can precisely control the fire and lock the essence of the juice. Just thinking about the steak that you want to taste in your childhood - the perfect maturity of the outer flavoured flavoured, the purple and juicy inside, so you can't wait! Next time, make sure to bring friends and experience this high-quality banquet with a sense of ritual and delicious."
A Point Steak & Bar,2024-05-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"The location is in Xinyi District, with convenient transportation, good atmosphere in the store, and friendly service staff.

A Point Steak & Bar,2024-02-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Good service and good food. Came here for dinner today. It’s for the Chinese New Year. The nature of spring wine is also anniversary. I think the lunch set meal is quite cost-effective. The portion of the beet salad is quite moderate. The bread can be refilled, it is quite soft and quite delicious. The decoration of the restaurant feels relatively traditional, maybe because it is country style with a bit of American style. The steaks are grilled over charcoal. There is the aroma of charcoal."
A Point Steak & Bar,2023-11-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"The food at Alpen Steakhouse is delicious, the atmosphere is pleasant, and the service is excellent. Every bite of steak exudes a tantalizing aroma that is unforgettable. The dining environment feels comfortable and cozy, making the overall dining experience more enjoyable. The service attitude of the staff is very friendly and attentive, making customers feel at home. Overall, Alpen Steakhouse is a restaurant worth revisiting."
A Point Steak & Bar,2023-11-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"The experience at Ebony Steakhouse and Tavern is a culinary journey. When we entered this charming restaurant, the first thing that struck us was the sophisticated interior and warm lighting that made us feel relaxed. There are many choices on the menu, but we decided to try the signature steak, which was grilled to perfection, extremely tender, and served with a well-prepared sauce. The service in the restaurant was also excellent, the waiter was warm and friendly and recommended a wonderful bottle of red wine that perfectly complemented our dishes. The whole dining process made us feel a high-quality dining experience, and Aipeng Steakhouse is definitely a place worth visiting again."
A Point Steak & Bar,2024-01-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Although the waiter recommended a three-point steak, I chose a five-point steak and it was no less good! After finishing the appetizers and before starting the main meal, a lemon smoothie is provided to take away the taste in your mouth. The music in the overall space is very comfortable and suitable for all ages."
A Point Steak & Bar,2024-05-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"In Taipei, the first choice Western restaurant for birthday celebrations is Aipeng. The service here is top notch and makes you feel right at home.

The rib-eye steak is cooked to perfection, charred on the outside and tender on the inside, the meat is delicious and full of aroma; the lamb chops are tender and juicy, and are even more delicious when paired with the special sauce. The restaurant's atmosphere is elegant and comfortable, making it an ideal place to celebrate a birthday.

A Point Steak & Bar,2023-08-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"2023.08.29 Today I came to Aipeng Steakhouse to celebrate my birthday with my family.

A Point Steak & Bar,2024-11-01T00:00:00Z,Family,The potato and steak CP value is above the level The salad leaves can be picked again Fresh cream in pumpkin sauce can be a little less Cream corn recommended to skip Overall good.
A Point Steak & Bar,2024-02-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"The environment is good and makes people feel very comfortable. The service staff is very good, very friendly and enthusiastic. The appetizer bread, smoked salmon and seafood soup are all very good, the pastry is amazing, my daughter loves it! The meal is delicious, but the steak is not hot enough. It can be reheated The service staff who ordered extra pasta specifically asked if the pepper should be removed and the doneness of the eggs, which was very considerate. My daughter liked it very much. The juice was delicious and the dessert was also delicious. I will come back in the future"
Host Shabu,2024-04-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"I found the highly rated Shabu Shabu on the Internet and it is very convenient to book a table on opentable! The environment is spacious and comfortable! The different meat set meals we ordered were all of good quality, and the prices in this environment were not too bad, not too exaggerated! The location in the mall is also easy to find, and you can take a stroll to digest your food after eating!"
Host Shabu,2023-08-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"合‧shabu carefully pursues the essential taste of the ingredients. Every ingredient served on the table is carefully selected by the chef. Whether it is seafood, meat or vegetables, they are not only top-notch and fresh, but the most important thing is that the dining environment here is not only comfortable but also special. The cyclone design circulates very well and doesn’t leave much of a smell after you finish your meal! The service staff is kind and courteous, familiar with their menu, and the service is professional and neat. They also provide tableside service. In addition to boiling the seafood to the best doneness, they will also help to shell the seafood, allowing us to dine in the most relaxed and stress-free environment. . It is convenient for transportation. It is located in Bellavita Poly Plaza in the Xinyi Project District. It is two minutes away from the MRT City Hall Station. There is also a city government transfer station nearby, which shortens the distance from various counties and cities. Parking is also convenient. Restaurants You can also go to the nearby movies and shop in department stores before and after. High-priced Japanese shabu-shabu, based on the above reviews, location, service, decoration, meal content, and portion size, the price/performance ratio is reasonable! For me, it is a good restaurant with 4 stars (out of 5 stars). I have left a good impression on both visits. Friends who like hot pot can try this combination of top ingredients. It is a good restaurant suitable for the whole family to share!"
Host Shabu,2023-08-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Delicious pot dishes are priced at a high unit price.

I would like to recommend this restaurant to everyone."

After the reaction to change the service staff, cooking seafood service experience is great, the professionalism is enough, and the shrimp service is really excellent! Because today 9/13 is family birthday, hope to have a good and warm dinner, thank you for the service staff, thank you ~"

Host Shabu,2025-11-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Eat used to regular guests is delicious! The most visited stove shop in winter~ Seafood is very fresh, and seafood is still alive.

Host Shabu,2023-09-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"There are a lot of diversified dishes to choose from, the service staff are friendly and friendly, the private room environment is clean and quiet, and the toilets are also very clean. It’s worth it if you come to Xinyi District for family dinners, friends gatherings, lovers’ dates, or celebration banquets. It’s worth it for a long time. Booking a private room once will make you feel more comfortable and private after the meal. It is worth recommending to everyone."
Host Shabu,2023-09-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"The environment in the Lady Department Store is very good. There is natural light on top. The ingredients are high quality. We ordered the Wagyu beef set meal and the American beef short rib set meal. The appetizers in the set meal were also very sincere. The salmon roe and yam service was also attentive. From the introduction menu, the dishes were served without disturbing the guests too much. But I can pay attention to the needs of customers. Generally speaking, it is recommended to go shopping and have a meal."
Host Shabu,2024-04-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"This hot pot restaurant offers a great value for money dining experience. The dishes are fresh and varied, the quality of the meat is excellent, and the soup base is rich in flavor and unforgettable. The dining environment is clean and comfortable, and the service is attentive and friendly. The price is affordable and makes people feel that it is worth the money. It is not an exaggeration to give it a 9-point rating. Whether you are having a dinner with friends or a family gathering, this is a good choice and highly recommended."

Host Shabu,2025-07-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Come to Taipei must eat one of the potatoes, ingredients fresh, Seafood shrimp on the table while still jumping alive, Japan and cattle also greatly pushed! The flowers are softly distributed, the entrance is easy, and there are many drinks to choose from."
Host Shabu,2023-08-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Finally got a chance to eat at Hermès in the hot pot world! ! This is my first time to eat top hot pot. The waiter is very professional and will help cook the ingredients. The vegetable plate is very fresh, and the seafood and beef appetizers are refreshing and delicious! Each location has similar independent partitions, providing privacy, which is very suitable for friends to gather for dinner! Beautiful environment, looking forward to visiting again in the future"
Host Shabu,2023-08-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"The meal time is Valentine's Day, and as soon as you enter the store, you can feel the aroma of the pot. The lighting and atmosphere are top-notch, and the menu includes meat and seafood. The price is on the high side but it's in line with the market and the ingredients are genuine. The set meal comes with appetizers, desserts and porridge cooking services after hot pot. If you order seafood, there is also a dedicated shelling service. Overall, it is highly recommended to those who want to celebrate. I give it a nine out of ten points."
Host Shabu,2024-04-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"The ingredients are very fresh, I recommend ordering beef and seafood! The mixed dishes cooked in the hot pot are also delicious. One person can eat two bowls. The price is about 1500-2000 yuan per person. The desserts after the meal are also delicious. It is very suitable for couples or family and friends to gather for dinner. The waiters are also very kind. ! In addition, children will receive free rice balls when they come!"
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2025-04-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Taiwan, known for its legendary culinary scene, has amazing food for every budget and preference. Yen, located within the W Taipei, is a solid choice for people wanting to try something out of the ordinary Chinese, yet remains true to its traditional roots. I curated the set menu myself for our family, and couldn't be happier with every single dish. The Peking Duck is very well prepared, rivals the one at Le Palais Taipei, and many high caliber, Michelin star worth establishments around the world. The staff hand carves the duck and hand wrap each piece for us. One particular incident I remembered from this meal was during the carving the chef accidentally dropped a piece of the duck onto the floor. (I've never seen this happen in my life) He then went back to the kitchen, and returned with a single piece of duck to add it into our dish to compensate. I thought that was...interesting. Although all the dishes were amazing, the particularly special dishes for me included the taichi crab steamed egg, the pepper fried dragon tiger grouper, and the king crab rice soup. The taichi crab steamed egg is perhaps the best chawanmushi/steam egg I have ever enjoyed in my life. they utilized the crab innards for the yellow side, and crab meat for the white side, separated with a green chain of chopped zucchini, all set on top of a silky smooth, crab dashi infused steamed egg. The result is a work of art that contains multiple layers of flavoring, intense and light, depending on the side of the dish you are eating. The dragon tiger grouper is typically steamed. The chef chooses deep fry means he is quite confident he isn't going to overdo it, and he did just that. The fried coating is thin and not overpowering, enables me to taste the fish's freshness, but at the same time, flavored with multiple layers of Chinese pepper corn, weaving numbing and spicy sensation velvety together. The king crab rice soup has a bit of a theatrics to it. Named after China's ancient beauty Xishi, the dish comes to the table with the broth and rice separated. The rice has both regular and rice crispies. When they pour the king crab bisque into the hotpot containing the rice, steam rises and rice crackle, with the steam meant to represent Xishi enjoying her bath. The dish had such an intense king crab aroma and flavor, made it irresistible to be licked clean. YEN in W Taipei has taken Chinese cuisine to a new level, by maintaining their traditional flavors and turn them into work of art. I highly recommend anyone to give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2022-11-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"The staff at YEN were so friendly and attentive. On a recent trip, I dined alone for both lunch and dinner. From my experience, most restaurants don't treat solo diners well and relegate them to some tiny corner of the restaurant. But not here. They sat me at a nice window seat and gave me all the attention that any diner would appreciate. They were super attentive, friendly and just overall fantastic. I don't think I could have asked for better servers and host. My server (a young man with red/orange dyed hair) was very accommodating and professional. I would go back just for the super service. But, I would return for the food. The food was delicious, very well presented. I chose a prix fixe for lunch which was very reasonable for about $50, and for dinner I had their famous Kao Ya (roast duck), bbq pork belly, and tiger prawns. It was a lot of food but I just had to try them. They were super delicious! And honestly, for the ambience, service, and food the price was really great. I would return to YEN on my next trip back to Taipei."
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2023-02-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Overall, it's not of a mediocre quality. It feels like the night view of Xinyi District is the main attraction rather than the food. The only thing I remember is the appetizer of mullet roe with apples It’s suitable for a temporary holiday when you can’t book a restaurant. XDD"
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2023-08-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"I came here to dine with my family in August. There were food residues on the table. I asked the service staff to clean the table before serving dessert, but I was told that this service was not available. After the on-site response to the chief officer, the table was cleared and disinfected in a big way. It was obviously intentional. After the supervisor informed me that the tea fee would be reduced, the service staff with a very disdainful attitude came to help pay the bill. It took an eternity to deal with it. It was a first time that I spent money to spend money in a five-star hotel and was humiliated!"
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2025-07-01T00:00:00Z,Family,For a top restaurant in an international hotel- you would expect the staff to speak English. They did not. They took out an app. It did not work well. One person spoke English. She took our orders. We received all food completely disordered. After we finished all food we received some vegetables. Just pure havoc. We received our cocktails with the food. Although we said we wanted them before our food. Took forever. You expect more. It wasn’t cheap either…. We refused to pay for the vegetables. Sorry- cannot recommend.
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2023-12-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"1. Zi Yan has regressed a lot after changing the chef. The taste, presentation and service are all very different. It seems like two different restaurants from before. The vegetarian dumplings were steamed until they fell apart, the cured rice was completely tasteless (a far cry from Peach Blossom Forest), the main dish of beef short ribs was served, the meat and plate were cold, and the prunes had no flavor at all. 2. I am deeply saddened that the Chinese restaurants that were once among the top three in Taipei have declined so quickly. Ziyan, please come on! The peach blossom forest that couldn't see your car's taillights before has now surpassed you!"
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2020-10-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"A very nice place to dine with family. The roast duck was well prepared, their services were very on point, their team knew when we needed to make separate orders or am finished with a course. Great attitude and they served food at an adequate speed. Especially like the presentation of the “seafood soup” in Chinese it’s called the 西施泡飯（xi shi pao fan）the fried Thai food poured onto the lobster braised soup, exquisitely done. One of the service team member 宇傑 was friendly, professional and we enjoyed our meal thanks to him. Would def come back again and recommend this place."
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2020-05-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Amazing Asian restaurant with great view on top of the W-hotel. Self Parking is complimentary just need to switch the elevator on 10th floor. The decoration of the restaurant was nice. The service was amazing, the view was great. The food comes with perfect size which is just enough and will not feel too hungry or too full. Make sure order the duck and crispy pork."
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2020-08-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Had an amazing dinner here with my wife. We ordered the Peking Duck, half chicken, pork belly, and seasonal vegetables. The Peking duck was so delicious! Loved how the staff cut it right in front of you and also wrapped it all up so you didn’t need to get messy with your hands. The skin was so crispy and tasted amazing. The service was here was what you’d expect at an upscale restaurant. The wait staff were extremely attentive and highly detailed. Was a very enjoyable experience."
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2025-04-01T00:00:00Z,Family,I would give it a four I thought the food was quite good. Actually I just thought the prices were very very high for what the food was as well the atmosphere not great specially for those prices I think in Taipei you can do much better.
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2016-10-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,Food is excellent Service is excellent Room is excellent View is excellent Worth for money. Will come again....
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2015-11-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"It's not our first time dining at Yen restaurant W Taipei. But we do have a very good impression of our previous dining experience so we decided to have our first local food in Taiwan at Yen again since we were staying at W Taipei. We were first being welcomed by the host at the entrance with a warm and friendly smile. Yen's interior always impresses us with its modern stylish design as a Chinese cuisine restaurant. Oops ! Time to take some pic first before seated down. ( : We were being served by Bunny Hu who's very attentive and knowledgeable with both Yen's wines and food menus. She's also flexible enough to move us to window table as soon as it's available. It's a must if you decide to dine at Yen as you can overlook a wide angle of Taipei city and partial view of the 101 tower. All the utensils, cutlery and chinaware that being served are as modern and stylish as its interior design. Check out their unique teapot and tea cups! Even though it's not our first time but still can't help taking pictures all over again. ( : As the wine that we preferred was not available, Bunny did not try to push or up sell us with more expensive range of wines they have on the wine list unlike many other high end restaurants do, yet Bunny was modest and sincere , she recommended us wine that suits our taste perfectly. Since it was just two of us, so we had to decide on something really worth trying. We decided to go for the steam giant garoupa fish scallion chili paste, steam cod fish with black beans and chili sauce as the fish dish portion serve as per person so Bunny suggested us to try two different fishes which we think it was a brilliant idea especially for a hungry couple who wanted to try everything on the menu! We also ordered stir fried chili frog legs which tasted no different with chicken, and it's very appetizing. For the green dish we ordered some local seasonal vegetables , not sure of its name in English but two thumbs up to this crunchy refreshing tasty vegetables which (according to Bunny) only specialize in Taiwan. Hope the picture I shared be able to help you order it. However the highlight of everything was the double boiled fish maw champignons soup with dried scallops! It was so flavorful that my picky partner commented that the chef must have prepared all his dishes with passions and with details. He loves cooking and making awesomely nice fine dine meals at home so he's quite particular when come to tasting and culinary. And we actually thought not even some overrated Michelin stars restaurant able to enhance the taste like what Yen provides. We had tried so many well known restaurants with their iconic Michelin titles all around the globe , not many deserve its entitlement. I'm sure many of us who enjoy great cuisines understand what I'm trying to express here. Benvo Peng , Yen manager always walk around making small talk with his guests and making sure if all guests enjoy the whole dining experience at Yen which I think it's a nice touch and very professional of him to show concern of his guests as well as his capability of leading a great team. When we asked for the bill, Bunny had automatically given us a 15% discount by checking and knowing that we are SPG member. What a WOW experience all the way! We had such a wonderful and memorable experience on the first day so we went for lunch again on the next day. We were being greeted almost instantly by Manager Benvo by addressing our name. We not sure if it's his special arrangement , he then seated us at another side of window table where Bunny our favorite server was in charge at that section on that day. Bunny was sweet enough for remembering our preference of fresh cut chili with soya sauce for my partner and without sauce for me. She also quickly brought us a good news that the wine we preferred finally available! Well this is what you call customer delivery! She constantly checking on us almost every few minutes even though she's away and preocuppied with other tables. She's so attentive that we felt like we being treated in first class cabin! Their signature roast duck with pancakes is another must try choice! Chef will demonstrate, carve and prepare the duck with it's accompaniments in front of you. Please have it when it's warm and juicy! We tried another doubled boil silky chicken soup with sliced winkle and ted dates which was truly and amazingly authentic taste of a genuine doubled boil soup we ever had! There's many more to describe and compliment about dining at Yen. From their excellent service delivery by Benvo and his awesome team to chef's skillful Michelin stars standard cuisines! it was surely a win win dining experience! We will definitely going back every time we visit Taipei. thank you for making our stay in Taipei a memorable one with taste!"
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2015-07-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Everything is high class. And not only because it is situated in the topmost floor of W hotel. The view outside on all sides is spectacular. The food presentation is very classy and of great culinary value. It is a trendy place. Do enjoy the bar. The whisky collection is very, very good."
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2013-11-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Let me first start by saying I am a Taipei resident so I have never stayed at W Taipei's rooms. This review is about the hotel's WOOBAR and Wedding services. I have never bothered to write any reviews (this is my first), but W Taipei's terrible service has pushed me over the edge. WOOBAR is an overrated bar. Since I'm a local, I've been quite a few times, but I always only go when friends visit from out of town. I must say the bar's atmosphere is great, and the decorations are top notch. However, the bartenders are in dire need of some major training. The very first time I went, I was served warm beer. I was in disbelief, and thought perhaps they had sold out or something. The second time I went, I was served warm beer again. I'm not sure how a 5-star hotel can have so much trouble stocking enough beers since it wasn't even a crazy holiday like New Years Eve. I then ordered Whisky Sour, and the bartenders failed miserably in making it. Ever since, I've resorted to the fail safe - Whisky on the rocks. But seriously, if you're from out of town and need a place to drink, there are a ton of places within a few minutes walking distance. Go to Brown Sugar, inHouse, Element, Stream, Barcode. Go next door to Meridien's Quube. Any of those places top WOOBAR. Now about the wedding services. I am planning on getting married next year and had thought about hosting it at W since the hotel's location simply can't be beat. So this morning around 9am I called up W Taipei, and it rings for a minute or so. No one picks up. I wait 5 minutes. Call again, and this time someone picks up, and transfers me to Wedding services, which ends up being voice-mail letting me know they'll call back. I leave my information, what I need, etc. No one calls back. My fiance calls again in the afternoon. No one picks up. She calls again in the afternoon and gets transferred to another phone which no one picks up. I'm not sure why W Taipei has such a distaste for simply picking up the phone. This is definitely not the standard of service a W hotel should have. We're done calling. We'll host the wedding some place where someone will actually pick up the phone. Even McDonald's picks up the phone when I call for delivery."
Yen Chinese Restaurant,2011-09-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Yen is located in the W Hotel and in accordance to the chic and high tech feel of the hotel, the restaurant is no exception. The view is spectacular and the food is good... especially compare to most western hotel restaurants. The service is decent and friendly as most servers are in Asia in general. The price is reasonable. Don't forget to check out their silvery statues as it's call made out of utensils.. very interesting art pieces."
Matsusaka Tei,2023-03-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,We tasted the most amazing food in this restaurant and the service was incredible. The tastes of the set menu are well worth the costs and I would thoroughly recommend the experience. The only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is that is amazing but too quick ! We are used to our expensive food treats taking time. However we were in and out in just over an hour. I’d ask them to slow it down. And then it would be perfect.
Matsusaka Tei,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"We went there for lunch and opted for the simple lunch set consisting of grilled ox tongues, wagyu tenderloins etc. The meat was of excellent quality and each table is assigned with a waiter to do the grills right at the table to ensure the meat is done perfectly and served immediately after it is cooked. Staff were very friendly and attentive. I think the price was very reasonable considering the quality of food and service I got. Don’t forget to order a pint of their local draft beer Taihu, it went really well with the roasts!"
Matsusaka Tei,2024-03-01T00:00:00Z,Family,Second time having lunch here. Service very professional as usual. The waygu quality was very good. Tender and full of flavour. Love the beef tartar and uni on top. Lunch set is a good choice. Check their lunch and dinner menu.
Matsusaka Tei,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"My 2nd time visiting here. Again, food is amazing. Service is consistently great. They surprised me with the private dining room and the birthday cake. Very appreciated. Great shout out to Eason, our service that day. He brought us a lot of joy!"
Matsusaka Tei,2019-11-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"This is our first time trying Matsusaka Tei and we enjoyed our meal very much. We opted for the sukiyaki lunch set meal. The experience here is different from the other yakiniku and sukiyaki restaurants we experienced in Japan. First, there were a few different cuts of beef, each representing a dish in a set meal, grilled by a server. Once that is done, the server cooked a slice of A5 wagyu beef in sukiyaki sauce and served it in beaten raw egg - such a bliss. This was then followed by fried rice and sliced beef sandwich (bread grilled with butter and onions) and finally dessert. Not cheap but well worth the experience."
Matsusaka Tei,2019-09-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,First time here and am thoroughly impressed by the service and food. Am surprised by the quality of beef tongue done in different ways. Thinly sliced or thick slice the tenderness of the tongue were really yummy. My friends came late yet Sun the server waited patiently for them and served us till the meal was over. I’ll be back when I go Taipei again.
Matsusaka Tei,2020-03-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"2019一年內去過三次，一次公共座位，二次包箱。可換和服體驗，且和牛割包特別，服務人員燒烤技巧也很到位。食材新鮮，價位亦成正比。包箱服務好很多，外場則要待加強！3 times a year, quality is perfect, but services depends on the price ? Well, good to try once."
Matsusaka Tei,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"We ordered the A5 sirloin sukiyaki set. The service was as outstanding as the quality of food. Every dish was served unhurriedly, the staff were attentive to the pace of cooking which was done on the spot. This is one restaurant that is worth coming back for."
Matsusaka Tei,2019-09-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,The A5 grade Wagyu is grilled to perfection by the server Sun.Excellent food with impeccable service and at very reasonable prices too.Will come back again to try their Sukiyaki
Matsusaka Tei,2019-10-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"I came here in October 2019 as I wanted to go somewhere special for my sisters birthday. This place was recommended to me so I went ahead and make a booking to ensure I got a table. The restaurant is within a shopping mall on the 6th floor. The exterior of the restaurant was nicely decorated. I was running late and usually there is only a 10mins waiting time but luckily I got there towards the end of lunch and they accommodated me. I was served by a lovely lady called Ting who even with a slight language barrier, tried to explain everything we had via a translator on her phone. This was much appreciated as we went ahead and ordered a set meal and had no idea what was actually included apart from telling her we was looking for A5 Wagu at the start. She explained the different sets they had and we opted for the $8800TWD (it was worth it!) The whole experience was very relaxing and enjoyable. Ting helped cooked all the parts of meat we had on the table, cooking them to their best and giving you that ‘melt in the mouth’ with every bite you had. If I’m back in Taiwan I would most probably come back just because everything was perfect."
Matsusaka Tei,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"My wife and I decided to indulge during our trip to Taipei to celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary,. And my oh my. What an extremely wonderful experience, and what extremely great food! Best of all what how Sun, the staff attending to us, explained everything to us and prepared the most wonderful food for us. He was attentive to our needs, requests and queries. He allowed us time to savour the loveliest beef prepared, and gave us insights into the food he prepared. Really worth the traveling and wait for this anniversary dinner. Thanks Sun and staff from Matsusaka Tei."
Matsusaka Tei,2019-11-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Great service, food quality was good but a bit pricy. We were celebrating my husband’s birthday and the staff sent their blessing and gave us a mini birthday cake as compliment."
Matsusaka Tei,2019-10-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,Enjoyed the high quality food and definitely worth the price compared to other neighbouring countries for this standard. Definitely would go again highly recommended for people who enjoy good beef and dinner with friends
Matsusaka Tei,2019-10-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Our first time here and we had the lunch menu with the Japanese A4 Wagyu. The quality of the food is amazing and the service was impeccable. TJ was our friendly server who helped us prepare our food at the table. She cooked the beef perfectly and was thorough in her explanations. We particularly enjoyed the extra thought of a cake for our special day. Do look for her if you’re heading here!! Overall, a delightful authentic yakiniku experience in Taipei with top of the line service and food. Recommended!"
Matsusaka Tei,2019-08-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Our waitress TJ provided us the first class service, from explaining the food menu, preparing the table setting, cooking the food, to giving helpful travel tips in TW. Japanese beef is always the best! A very enjoyable dinner!"
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2025-02-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Also visited several times before The whole is delicious But there was less than at the end of last year. No one would like to follow the package. Very willing to eat a little myself Results disappear from the menu or cannot be single-pointed Especially fried potatoes I've also talked to friends before if there is a portion size. Really delicious, just two people after eating the main meal a little stud The result is not visible. Have come back to notify me! Also hope that something in the package can open a single point The previous one can touch close to the package, but you can adjust something you want to eat or don't want to eat, each time you go, you can have a new try This time only eating fixed packages is boring. But the meal is still delicious Axis pigs are a little dryer than before"
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2023-07-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"You can overlook the night view of Taipei City. The scenery is definitely the most amazing in Taipei. The cold fronts at the feet of the outdoor box were extremely cold both times I went there (but the waiter will provide blankets) But it is recommended not to wear sandals or shorts if you go at night. The bee needles on the private table are super XDDD In terms of food, I want to try afternoon tea next time~~"
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2025-05-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"The restaurant finally reopens! New Bar food is great, beef chips and sandwich push! Drinking with night view is comfortable It is recommended that you can arrive early to find the 101 location, take pictures more beautiful -"
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2024-12-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Taipei's best rooftop bar with a view. The night view is panoramic, the cocktails are delicious and reasonably priced, and the music selection is excellent. A must-visit when traveling to Taipei to fully experience the charm of Taipei's nightlife."
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2024-02-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"I come to parties every time, but this time I came to this dinner because a friend invited me... Oh my god! The food here is amazing! And the price is reasonable and the service is in place! Big recommendation! ! Not to mention the night view here is so beautiful"
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Made a wasted trip here. I intended to watch the sunset from the sky bar. When I arrived around 6pm, I was told that the entire place was only open for drinks from 9pm. I could not come in for a drink. Seems the management has missed the point - people looking for a quick 6pm drink are not looking for 9pm drinks at a club/lounge. Might be something worth reviewing."
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2025-07-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"The cocktails at CÉ LA VI are truly top-tier exceptional in quality. Even my friend, who usually doesn’t drink, ended up ordering two cocktails in a row. Unbelievable! As for the view. it goes without saying. Other than the 101 Observatory, CÉ LA VI offers the best skyline in town. The music? Absolutely amazing. Each DJ brings a unique style and energy. From the stunning view, delicious food, exquisite drinks, and great music, to the venue and attentive service , everything was spot on. C’est la vie , this is life. An unforgettable dining experience!"
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2024-11-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Very poor service, very poor attitude! Go to Don't Go. Bad and bad, absolutely no care for the needs of the guests. In the end too angry gone, the manager still want to laugh and say goodbye"
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Super fancy bar/club with spectacular views of Taipei 101. Great music. Antiseptic vibe. Lots of westerners and English spoken, along with the concomitant snooty attitude and prices. It gets packed on the weekends so go for a drink during the week and check out the views"
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2024-11-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"We tried to get into the bar for drinks. The staff were so rude, we left. These were the only rude people we encountered in all of Taipei. If you want a nice place to watch the sunset outside with a perfect view of the Taipei 101 building, Morton's is a better spot to go to."
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2019-07-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,I guess this place has only done a soft launch. Was there on a Saturday night and it was empty. Great ambiance and bar layout.
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2024-11-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Did not feel welcome, very rude large man working at bar. Refused to add extra chair to table and tried to force us to sit outside even though place was half empty"
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2019-11-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"We had booked the afternoon tea for my birthday in November. 1month in advance. Upon arrival we were met by 2 hostesses, busy talking to each other. After a moment of awkward we were told to wait aside with no smiles. Anyhow, after about 10 minutes a waitress came. Her big smile and courteous manner has eased us to our table. The first impression was wow! What a view. The entire place is facing the infamous 101 building ( we were on 48th floor). We can see the whole town beneath and the mountains in distance in front of us. As we are descending in our table which built below the deck I notice: The couch is really in need of upholstery. As we sitting down I see a few cigarette burn holes around. I was kind of disappointed We ordered Olong and Darjeerling tea to come with the “afternoon tea”. The waiter brought the food and recommended us to eat from top down and there’s no honey nor brown sugar available for the tea as we requested!! To my disappointment the tea was pretty plain. There is not a lot of flavor in either one. Common! Taiwan is the king of tea. I have drink tea and visit Taiwan for more than 30 years. My wife is from Taiwan and we have come back here all the time so we know the tea here. Anyway we try the food. It’s okay! The sweet pastries was very milky taste but not too bad!!! We share our thoughts. Oh boys we were so wrong!!! The savory treats was actually quite good though. We agreed! After we almost finished the meal, my lady start to have mild stomachache. We thought it might be the dairy in the sweet, it will go away...! We left and go to the famous Yongkang street in Da’an district , where there’s many unique shops and restaurants. We were strolling around shopping and looking. My lady was: my stomachache is getting worse. Are you ok? Should we go to the doctor? No it’s not too bad! She replied Maybe we should have some hot soup, so we stopped by a restaurant and ordered some soup. While waiting for the food. My lady started shivering and groaning: no! I gotta go! She rushed to the toilet and THROW UP EVERY WHERE ON THE TOILET! ALL OF IT!!! The “afternoon tea”. She came back looking all pale and let me know what’s just happened. I felt much better now, She exclaimed! Great you can have some hot soup. Oh no! I should rest. After a few minutes she rushed in the toilet again and craps everything out!!!!! We were horrified, packed Togo and went home."
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2025-05-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,Mocktails are excellent. Sunday Lover has lots of mint leaves. Paradise’s Kiss is a wonderfully butter texture bear. Would come back for these amazing drinks.
CÉ LA VI Taipei,2024-12-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Great Kitchen and Amazing view to the 101 Tower, Panoramic vision to the FantasticTaipei Basin, A Great party venue as well !"
Texas Roadhouse,2023-10-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"The waiters are very friendly. It's just that the food and the requested items may take a long time to come out because of the shortage of staff, but that's understandable. Overall it's ok because it's not the first time to have a meal. I hope they can make up for the manpower to make the customer experience and dining more perfect."
Texas Roadhouse,2025-11-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Being a Texas resident and a frequent customer of Texas Roadhouse restaurants in Texas, I couldn't believe that there was one in Taipei - had to try. I'm happy to say that this is the real deal. Good steaks and just about the same menu that you'd find in USA locations. The one surprise was that no Budweiser, Michelob, or other American beer was available; the featured draft was San Miguel."
Texas Roadhouse,2025-03-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Excellent dining option at Texas Roadhouse, located in a modern shopping area very close to Taipei 101. Very good service with excellent cuts of meat in the American style. Cinnamon butter rolls. Reasonable prices.."
Texas Roadhouse,2017-06-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"A typical American style restaurant. Food is good, service is great. Wearing T-shirt with the logo: ""I love my job"", all staff are energetic, enthusiastic, initiative, friendly and helpful. Thank them very much."
Texas Roadhouse,2019-11-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,American fast casual restaurant that we come twice a month for 2 years now. Similar to friday’s or chilli’s in some ways but seems to have nicer mains and steaks. The free peanuts and evening jigs also nice gimmicks
Texas Roadhouse,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Great location not far from Taipei 101. Typical for “Texas Roadhouse” , plenty choices for meat lovers. The size of the servings are pretty big so be careful how much your order."
Texas Roadhouse,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"I have to admit that when I visited this restaurant my initial feelings were skeptical. However, I was proved completely wrong. The service was impeccable and the food was absolutely delicious. I had the Steak & Rib combo with a baked potato. The Texas Roadhouse is well worth a visit."
Texas Roadhouse,2014-11-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,I shared a slab of ribs tonight at this restaurant. They are as good as the best ribs I have eaten in Texas. The creamed corn was amazing. I also shared a Caesar salad. The lettuce was crisp and the dressing not too heavy. The service and atmosphere were exceptional. We enjoyed the music and the line dancing--great fun. Their mint-infused lemonade quenched my thirst. I thanked our server for asking if I wanted my water with or without ice.
Texas Roadhouse,2024-12-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Decent food and decent experience for a decent price. Nothing special or extraordinary (it’s a chain), but if you are craving for ribs or steaks at an affordable price you will not go wrong here."
Texas Roadhouse,2018-07-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"After discovering our hotel had no restaurant and all the local eateries were cash only and we had some trouble determining the spice levels in local dishes we decided to try something out of character. Was a bit strange entering through a basketball store but once we found our way up to level 3 we entered a bustling burger and steakhouse full of locals so it gave us a bit of confidence. All our meals (group of 6) were good with steaks, ribs, burgers and fries, sides all good food. The little dance routine the staff did was strangely fun. A bit out of place in Taiwan but was a welcome change to local food after 2 weeks in Asia. Good safe food and beer and one of the few places in Taipei we found decent white wine."
Texas Roadhouse,2017-02-01T00:00:00Z,Family,The staff is well mannered. Surprising no need for tip? They do the special dance hoe down. Its quite entertaining on top of the food. Great selection on steak and drinks.
Texas Roadhouse,2017-09-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"The reception, and the service was outstanding. Though we didn't have a reservation, the desk found us a table very quickly. We were served by Ben, who couldn't have been more helpful. A quick look round confirmed that all the staff seemed to be the same top quality as ours. Top marks to the Front of House Manager! The welcome bucket of peanuts was great (and they were good quality). The basket of warm bread on the table was a good touch, but here it started to go wrong - the bread rolls were sweet! They should have been with the dessert, not as a starter! We wanted to eat the bread with our salad, but couldn't, as it was so sweet. Washed our mouths out with the excellent draught Taiwan Beer, then carried on without bread. Sadly, the salad could have been good, but was covered with that weird orange artificial cheese that Americans use for cooking. Guys, cheese should be made from milk - not from homogenised fats + colouring in a factory! We had to go through the salads & pick it all off before eating. Our sirloin steaks came. They were tasteless, and definately NOT sirloin. Sirloin has a rim of fat round the edge, and threads of fat running through the meat. We know a bit about steaks, as we keep beef ourselves! These were tasteless, fatless, perfectly formed pieces of meat. See my photo below. Google sirloin steak for yourselves and see what it should be. I can only guess these were pieces of topside beef, shaped and cut in a mould of some sort. Both our pieces were identical twins - whoever saw 2 identical sirloin steaks before? To be fair though, they were both cooked exactly as we had asked - 60 deg. Then the 'Texas Fries' - damp, soft and soggy. We both had to leave them on our plates. My wife who knows a thing or two about potatoes says that a) they used the wrong variety - the same variety they were using for mash. You cannot make fries from this! and b) the fat wasn't near hot enough to crisp them. So, all in all, they need to promote the house manager, and sack the head chef."
Texas Roadhouse,2017-07-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Yes, I get it that I am not in the US anymore but some things should be standard, such as, fall off the bone ribs, the peanuts, sweet tea, grilled corn etc. All disappointed from what I am accustomed to. Now the Salmon was one of the best I ever tasted and the baked potato was good. So there were some good and bad explaining my average score."
Texas Roadhouse,2016-05-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"I would give it a 3.5. but there is no point five. The food is good, in between a average and very good. The food was served fast, the service was good with the fact that when you call any waiters or waitress, they won't ignore you like some other restaurants. Also they would not keep on coming to bug you in the middle of the conversation. I prefer this style. Keep on bugging the customers while they are talking or eating is not called good service. The atmosphere is more suitable for friends or colleagues gathering since it's jolly and lively. Maybe a bit noisy for those who prefer quieter dining environment."
Texas Roadhouse,2016-03-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Very poor service, very poor attitude! Go to Don't Go. Bad and bad, absolutely no care for the needs of the guests. In the end too angry gone, the manager still want to laugh and say goodbye"
WOOBAR,2024-08-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Visited on our last night in Taipei. The ambiance was fantastic, enhanced by a live DJ playing great music. It’s a classic spot for a dinner out. While the food leans on the expensive side and is of fair quality, the overall experience is still worth trying."
WOOBAR,2023-10-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Like any WOOBAR around the world, it has that same dim lighting, funky decor and sexy ambience. Great atmosphere, cool music. Staff are very pleasant and friendly. Service was of a high standard. Good choice of drinks including fresh juices and non-alcoholic cocktails if you don't drink like me. The cocktail was so good! NUTRITION CONCOCTION! Have it! Fresh blueberry, made ginger beer and fresh apple juice. I had two of the same one. Busy on a Friday evening. You don't need to dress up so much but look presentable. My small negative was cost! It was almost 20 USD for 2 non-alcoholic cocktails! Maybe see if there is a Happy Hour. Worth a treat. Would recommend otherwise. I didn't eat there but I believe they have a food or light snack menu. If you are not staying at the hotel, you can still go."
WOOBAR,2024-03-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"This spot seems quiet on a weekday - if you're looking for a busy, buzzing atmosphere this may not be the place for you during the week. I stayed here till after 9pm and it didn't liven up at all. The food is all generally good. Mainly bar food. Cocktails and drinks are also really good. Staff are very friendly and helpful! The Wetbar next door may also be open on occasion. Worth checking before visiting. My advice would be to stop here for a quick drink before heading somewhere else (unless it's the weekend)."
WOOBAR,2023-03-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"The Woo Bar is very stylishly furnished and is a popular meeting place for the local high society, especially in the afternoon. We liked the interior, including the outdoor area. However, the quality and the food at dinner in the Woo bar left a lot to be desired, especially considering the prices. What's more, some dishes were not available and we were not convinced by the selection on the menu. Would not eat here again."
WOOBAR,2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"An Australian friend and his fiancé invited me for meeting up for both leisure and business talk. It is nice and secluded area and good for business gathering. Food are drink are good, more importantly the friendly gesture of the staff, particularly Abbey whom we were served. She is attentive and hovial, friendly and can easily chat with us and even provided is a reading lamp when we referred to a drawing under there dim conditions. Though the location is further but it is definitely one of the best way with drinks and food finger + good staff you could get here."
WOOBAR,2021-02-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"I like W Hotel quite a lot, even though it is pricey, it is certainly worth every cent. Woobar has a nice view of the 101, and at the heart of Taipei City in Xinyi District, it has a nice pool and a nice indoor bar for chilling. I really like their service too, they have nice great food and drink. Namo Amituofo"
WOOBAR,2023-07-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"The outdoor landscape of WOO BAR is really beautiful. Every corner is super chill. It's the kind of place where you can stay there all afternoon. It was also very comfortable to stay outdoors and chat with friends at night. A place where you forget time There aren’t many memorable points about the food and wine, but they’re not bad."
WOOBAR,2020-03-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,It was my third time to visit woobar Taipei and was there for a couple of hours. Had a great experience as usual. the staff is attentive and friendly.Special mention to Bona that give suggestion a special drink.
WOOBAR,2021-01-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Nice bar and decor. Prices though are no good. I went to hotel bar in South Taiwan like this one near my company, and this place was much higher so not good value for your spend."
WOOBAR,2023-05-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"The famous bar in every W around the world. Like the rest of the hotel, it’s stylish but pretty mundane compared to say W Seoul with the spanish steps design. Good music, drinks and vibes"
WOOBAR,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"We came here every afternoon. There is an interesting cocktail list. They also serve Perrier Joët by the glass (which is not a common occurrence!!) Ambiance is beautiful, elegant, and trendy. Service is good. Great hotel bar."
WOOBAR,2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,Amazing view and atmosphere. The truffle fries is amazing 👌 Great service and delicious food as well. Nice to relax and chill.
WOOBAR,2019-09-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"After having spent a long afternoon and paying for multiple rounds of overpriced drinks in Woo Bar and then dining in the adjacent Kitchen Table for dinner, we asked to return back to Woo Bar and requested a table near the entrance almost identical to the table we had occupied throughout the afternoon. We were told that the table (early on a Monday evening during a typhoon....) would have a minimum spend of $15,000. The staff was so shockingly dismissive to that fact that our party had spent well over that amount already throughout the afternoon that we left immediately. There were many empty tables and asking for such an absurd minimum spend during a quiet Monday night has proven that Woo Bar staff have not been trained in proper hospitality. This incident was such a disappointment because we had enjoyed our afternoon and evening so far. We would be far more accepting of this type of policy during a busy time for the bar, but staff being unable to accommodate paying customers like this is truly poor form."
WOOBAR,2019-09-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,One of the best experience that I have been in the category. Drinks and service is nice and professional.
WOOBAR,2019-07-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,An extremely chic and fashionable Bar. It gets crowded from 10PM onwards with Live entertainment and great cocktail parties. Vivian offered a memorable and friendly service throughout my visits at WOO.
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2023-12-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"We were initially told by the front desk of a cheaper price and that kids dined for free, but found out from the cafe staff that was not true. We were about to walk off but one of the staff went out of her way to accommodate us. We are very grateful for the kind staff who went out of their way to help us. Would definitely recommend this cafe!"
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2024-01-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"I was staying at the Grand Hyatt, so I enjoyed 4 breakfasts and one lunch here. The place is very busy; there are often queues, sometimes with ropes to aid their formation. The café serves breakfast, lunch, dinner and afternoon tea. Note breakfast is for hotel guests only, all are welcome at other times. Prices are higher on weekends. At breakfast, Western and several types of Asian cuisine (Taiwanese, Chinese, Indian, Japanese) are offered, and the selection is plentiful, with minor variations each day. I came at the 6:30 am opening time each day, when the queue was just for waiting for the doors to open. After checking your name and room number, you are escorted to a table and instructed to adjust the ""Available/Occupied"" card on your table accordingly. The clearing of dishes and tables was very efficient, as turnover is high. Food was of good quality. Everything is serve yourself, including coffee from those fancy machines. The queue forms immediately for the omelet/fresh egg station, but goes quickly. There can also be a wait for the made-to-order noodle bar. At lunch, you are checked in and seated without the occupancy card. I made a reservation for lunch, but this is probably not required. Your check is brought to you when it appears you are nearly finished. Again, the bountiful options include Western (including prime rib) and Asian, with many Japanese seafood and sushi selections. You can see the chefs slicing huge slaps of fish beginning during the breakfast hours. Many of these Japanese choices were also seen at the buffet at Irodori, the Hyatt's Japanese restaurant, where I also dined. The dessert bar included a chocolate fountain. Beer on tap is offered. Seating is nicely separated into multiple dining sections, with a variety of seating/table styles. There are restrooms within the restaurant. A very pleasant and filling dining option, especially for hotel guests."
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2024-06-01T00:00:00Z,Business,"We stay at the Grand Hyatt Taipei a lot!! This place is amazing for business breakfast or for a family meal. There is a wide variety of offerings from Western, Chinese, Japanese, Salads, fresh pastries and fruit. All the food is delicious and the ambience is bustling. But the best part of The Café is the service. Each morning, when we head downstairs for breakfast, we are greeted by Elsa. She calls us by our first names (with permission) and always greets us with a hug. She had taken the time to get to know us, where we like to sit, and she even notices when we are not there. She is such a great ambassador for the Grand Hyatt. As we watch her work in the restaurant, we have noticed that she builds relationships with many of the guests who frequent the Grand Hyatt. We have chatted with many and we all feel the same way about Elsa. She makes you feel AT HOME, even when you are far away from your friends and family."
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"There were 3 dining times to choose from; lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. This review will cover the afternoon tea. Afternoon tea is from 3pm~5pm, it is the cheapest of the 3. The price is NT$865 per person (EZ table exclusive offer), service fee included. The original price is about NT$1,100 per person service fee included. 1) seating: The seating is too close and crowded. The spacing is not even an arm's length away. We sat at a 2 seat table. 2) Service and atmosphere; The service is good. the staff is friendly and service speed is fast. 3) Food; The food selection is great; there are dim sum, Chinese food, Indian food, some Taiwanese dishes, Japanese food, and some generic western dishes. The desert is great, I think it's better than many buffet at this price range. If your dinning purpose is celebrating birthday you get a birthday cake for free, you can either eat it at the spot or take it home with you. Overall I recommend it, it's one of the few buffets I think that's worth visiting again, only at a discount price. There are better choices to choose from at the NT$1,100 range."
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"My mother-in-law made a reservation for New Years Eve here for the entire family and paid full price to secure it. About ten days before the event, they called her and told her that the price of the dinner had doubled. She did not want to do this so she asked them to cancel and they agreed and told her they will refund her the dinner. New Years Eve comes and they call her to tell her that since she did not show up for dinner, she will be charged. Interestingly they charged the original amount not the double amount they later quoted. We are upset about this because they did not cancel the reservation as they said. Also it is strange that they change their prices after already being paid. Unfortunately, Taiwan is not as big on consumer rights as we are in the United States so the credit card company would not allow the charge to be refused. I personally think this is very dishonorable behavior and I recommend that people take their business elsewhere."
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2020-10-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"I have eaten at the Hyatt buffet many times and it maintains a consistently high standard. I especially like the Western food, which can be expensive elsewhere; let's face it, you can get good Chinese food any day of the week in Taipei. I am not a great fan of Indian food, but I tried some and I thought that it was okay. I especially liked the desserts. In all, it's a good meal for what you pay."
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2022-05-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Cafe at the Grand Hyatt Taipei has a reputation for offering a bountiful buffet, with no limits on how many times you return to the tables. Apart from Chinese dishes, you can feast on Japanese, Western and Indian cuisines. The Grand Hyatt is walking distance to thw World Trade Centre and Taipei 101, Taiwan's tallest building."
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"We went to the Grand Hyatt to have a hearty and plentiful breakfast. First to mention, they were very busy yet the staff provided outstanding service. Haven't seen that for a long time. The servers were very fast to offer coffee refills and clear dirty dishes. The buffet is quite large, lots of choices, from the typical Western pastries and hot items to Chinese to Korean and other pan Asian food. A great breakfast experience."
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2020-04-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,Great place for family gatherings with excellent services and food. I left a special request for hoping to have a table at a quieter place and the Cafe offered us a great spot which my family was all happy about it. The variety of food/drinks/dessert was satisfying and the food ordered from the vegetarian menu was also amazing. Definitely recommended!
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2022-01-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Taipei people love a buffet, and the Cafe is never disappointing. The wide variety of cuisines, apart from Chinese, include Japanese, Indian and Western. Few diners can resist the dessert menu. I alwys makie a trip to the Cafe when I'm in Taipei; the only drawback is that I can't resist having seconds -- or thirds."
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2021-08-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"The Grand Hyatt's buffet is famous for its great variety of food. The cuisine includes Chinese, Western, Japanese and Indian, The Cafe has the reputation for being one of the most plentiful buffets in Taipei. By the way, you can ear as much as you like."
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2020-11-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"On Saturday, November 14th we were invited to the Grand Hyatt for lunch. I have eaten there many times before and I have always enjoyed the wide selection of food served at the buffet. The two outstanding dishes of the day, was hands down, an amazing Truffle Risotto and a Sweet & Sour Shrimp dish. The service has definitely improved and it was excellent. For me, personally I didn't think the curry dishes were very tasty but my son LOVED it. To all the chefs, keep on preparing such delicious food!"
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2021-10-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,Well-educated waiters and waitresses gave high-quality services. Sona’s friendly and professional service impressed me a lot. It's a nice place I would like to come back occasionally. 早餐提供的服務 無微不至 Sona 很用心 主動詢問房客 餐點是否足滿意 個別化 客製化的細心 讓人印象深刻 這是一個用心的好餐廳
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2021-03-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"The Cafe is the Hyatt's buffet. You get a good selection food, including Indian, Japanese, Chinese and Western. It's a good place to try new cuisines. It's always a temptation to pig out. Prices very according to the session time, but it's not expensive for what you get."
Café - Grand Hyatt Taipei,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,Tried the lunch buffet here a year ago. Was blown away by the variety of food offered and quality. Tried their afternoon tea buffet the other day. It was very good but paled in comparison with the lunch (and dinner I'm sure)..Given that it's an afternoon tea it's understandable that there would be fewer choices. Still it was a bit disappointing. We have an egg allergy there were very few choices for her unfortunately. There were a lot more choices for her when we had lunch here a year ago.
Yen Bar,2024-01-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"It’s a nice bar with a view on Taipei 101 tower and the city. Good signature cocktails and snacks. There are wine, liquors and strong alcoholic spirits as well. After 6pm you can also order a food from the main restaurant. Service 10% is included into the check. Free wi-fi."
Yen Bar,2019-07-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,Visited here by myself to have afternoon tea set. Price was 900 TWD (+10%) for 1 person. I think price is quite reasonable. Cake and other things were good enough to enjoy with 101 tower view. I realised that it would be greater if i were visit there as a couple while i was having coffee haha. I recommend you to make a reservation if you want to have a seat with 101 tower view.
Yen Bar,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"We group have 20 ppl in the place and we do ordered pretty much several bottles of wine, fried chicken and fries as meal.Too expensive for $196 a bottle wine but selling $2000.However, it a cozy place, and service is properly offered. The drinks are OK but only weakness is way too expensive if you open a bottle of wine. If I can choose again, I would directly head to woobar downstairs. Otherwise, I have nothing to say. 我們有約莫20人訂位，餐廳一切都OK..直到我們發現賣給我們的白酒每瓶其實是200元左右的白酒，但是現場售價卻是2000元時，我們已經喝了不下11,12瓶以上的各式紅白酒以及各類餐點，太貴了，售價有點離譜了"
Yen Bar,2019-06-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Let you relax and have a good view. Friendly service. The snack design is very creative. There is room for improvement in the price of wine. The person will match the client's language, for example: deliberately ask in another language and answer the same language. This is a place to be. The sofa area is very comfortable. The personnel can be correspondingly younger. The space design is good. Bartending is a must drink. If it is going at night, the night scene is very beautiful. If you are a 3-5 friend, it is a good choice. f you ask me will you go again? Will say: Don't miss it.Details? Then you personally experience it. As his name: Purple is its wings. Light and shadow is its eyebrow shape. When you come to Taiwan, you should go to the top floor of this W hotel. Ignore that night shop is noisy and mixed. It is gracefully waiting for you to come. The atmosphere will make you relax and the snacks are very chic. Bring some of Taiwan's culture into it. The least favorite is that it has room for improvement in the price of red wine and actual quality. Convenient food is a Shanghai dish next to it. Self-experience: When I need to be leisurely ten, it is one of the choices. 讓您放鬆身心並欣賞美景。 友善的服務。      小吃設計很有創意。 葡萄酒的價格還有提高的空間。 此人將與客戶的語言相匹配，例如：故意用另一種語言詢問並回答相同的語言。 這是一個地方。 沙發區非常舒適。 人員可以相應地年輕。 空間設計很好。 調酒是必須喝的。 如果是在晚上，夜景非常美麗。 如果您是3-5個朋友，那是一個不錯的選擇。 你問我你會再去嗎？ 會說：不要錯過它。細節？"
Yen Bar,2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Thank you for Willy, Jessie great service, always be so nice and hospitality, hope next time I could come back again. This time we order Flowery set, the cake and foods is so dedicated and taste really delicious👍🏼"
Yen Bar,2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Loved the W vibe and wonderful view! Thanks to Meek, Willy, Jessie and Otis for a great service and experience! Will definitely be back for the Flowery Yen afternoon tea again"
Yen Bar,2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Ozzie and Jessie were both excellent at serving us during our time at Yen bar. We requested a table near the window but since we were not staying at W Taipei, this couldn't be guaranteed. However, when we arrived, we were given a table with an amazing city view! Ozzie recommended us cocktails based on our preference and it turned out perfect. Highly recommend this place, must visit!"
Yen Bar,2019-11-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,Staff was cordial and all smiles. We came to try their afternoon tea and fortunately was able to partake of their last set. Food wise there wasn’t much to eat (quite small) but the price itself was worth the four cocktail drinks that was included. Not much of a view since it was overcast and their glass needs cleaning. But it was nice and serene to have some drinks and chat with friends.
Yen Bar,2019-10-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Ozzie's service attitude is very good - everyone is very friendly, the atmosphere is very great, the environment is beautiful, and the wine is also very good, very suitable for friends to meet! Or chat! The day and night view are astonishing!"
Yen Bar,2019-10-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,Spent my birthday here with family and we had a private lounge for 6 people. Located on level 31 with sensational views. Cocktail menu is extensive. Snack menu is delicious. Waiters were attentive. We had Ozzi who looked after us well. So for 6 people with a few snacks we paid around $400 (Australian).
Yen Bar,2019-09-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,Absolutely amazing cocktails and atmosphere. Service was implacable too. Must try while in Taipei ❤️
Yen Bar,2019-09-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"The Yen Bar is situated in the 32nd floor of the W hotel opposite the 101 and offers stunning views over the city, especially in night time. The staff is very attentive. As a hotel guest with a Bonvoy Elite status, you can enjoy free drinks during the happy hour from 5-7pm."
Yen Bar,2018-11-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,A terrific view with cozy atmosphere getting you out of the main hotel bar scene for something a little more quiet and unobtrusive social gathering with co workers or friends.
Yen Bar,2019-09-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,氣氛很棒的酒吧 是在頂樓的酒吧 可以俯瞰整個信義區 進來後可以感受到大家都很親切meek willy.... 尤其Ozzie 服務很好 人超好 ～～ 這次是喝otis的調酒 twinkle eyes！ 最後lion還有請一杯nutrition concoction 是一個整體體驗超棒的酒吧～

Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2023-10-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"During the meal that day, there were live singing and violin performances by resident singers. The food was delicious and the portions were sufficient. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was very good. Unfortunately, there were many people that day and the meal delivery was slow. However, the service attitude was very good and proactive. As long as there is a vacant seat by the window, we will take the initiative to help arrange it. What is particularly impressive is that the toilet is very clean and has a whole floor-to-ceiling window, which can perfectly see the night view."
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2021-01-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"You are paying for the view when you dine at a restaurant like Diamond Tony's, which is on the 85th floor of Taipei 101, the city's tallest building. The food at Diamond Tony's is adequate but perhaps not as good as one would expect for the money you are paying. It's advisable to book ahead and request a window table."
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2021-05-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,We celebrated Mother’s Day with party of 3. Excellent service takes cares to all of our needs. The lunch set is beyond my expectations with nice taste and delicate presentation. We were really enjoying all experiences in Diamond Tony’s 101.
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2024-12-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Reopen after renovations is missing the mark. The restaurant has misses in food, service and drinks. The only strongly positive aspect is the location. Overall, the food is 3+. The food menu is limited to 5-course meals which resulted quite a few tables taking take-away boxes with them. The food itself has more misses than hits. Especially the appetizers we had, burrata and the veal, felt that they were made from supermarket sets. The mushroom and onion soups were passable. The entrees had some interesting tries, e.g. the beef doughnut was visually intriguing, but the taste and texture didn’t deliver. Scallop risotto tried something different with barley. The main dishes were the best dishes, but still had flaws. Lamb rack was dry. Both the lamb rack and duck breast lacked seasoning and barely had sauce, vegetables, or other components with the meat. Dessert tiramisu was a safe choice. Service was lacking finesse. We needed to constantly ask for e.g. more water, cutlery, etc. there appeared to be plenty of people working, but somehow the service was slow and felt distant in both Mandarin and English. We ended up eating for 2.5 hours, which is about the time expected, but we felt that we were constantly waiting for the next dish. The drinks list included only 4 mediocre wines. They explained that it was due to “test run”, so it might get better in the future. The ambiance was an interesting mix of disco and high end dining. Piano and a singer. Then electronic dance music. The restaurant is a bit missing its soul."
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2020-03-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"The view at high floor of Taipei 101 is good for sure. And the price for lunch is really reasonable. However, the dishes could be much more delicate. For instance, there's too much mayonnaise on the salad, making it tastes too heavy."
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2018-04-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,I think it’s over priced and over acclaimed for the food’s worth. I had a fish salad and lamb chop. While the salad is alright the lamb chop is utterly disappointing and it’s lukewarm. It felt like it was cooked from a frozen item. My friends ordered steak and it’s not really a steak - very thin cut and joe matching the description on the venu. Service was slow. I won’t go back again
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2014-05-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"We went to the Panorama bar for food and drinks. There's a minimum spend requirement, so once you go up, you're stuck with a bill. Once we were shown our seats, we were basically forgotten. Waited a long time to be given a menu, waited longer to have our orders taken (had to flag down about 3 different staff), then the drinks took even longer! The food was served before the drinks. The food was pricey and nothing special. It was a rainy day, so we didn't get to see the view, a huge waste of time!"
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2015-10-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"We arrived and ordered two gin and tonics, they took 35 minutes to arrive, in fact we had finished our starter before they arrived. We also ordered wine which took ages. However the food was like it was on a conveyer belt, speed eating in my opinion, no choice but a set menu! Great location but the restaurant is like a fast food place, not worth the the prices they charge. The staff are uninterested and dull, which is very unusual for Asia. Not a good experience, I would suggest you save your money rather than visit this place. We travel the world regularly and this is the worst restaurant we have had the unfortunate experience to frequent."
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2015-07-01T00:00:00Z,Business,"The food, service and view were terrific. I really enjoyed my lunch. They were very accommodating and had many food options."
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Well, had a dinner with a friend. Both of us enjoyed the view and drinks. But expecting more on the food with that kind of price. The food didn't worth to pay that amount of money."
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2014-04-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"The view is excellent, but that's the only reason for you to consider coming to this restaurant. The quality of the food is just like that in a fast food shop. Very disappointed! 景觀上，服務中，食物下 星級餐廳定位，快餐店食物 非常失望!"
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2019-06-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"You MUST go to this restaurant! Best views and food in Taipei. Even the BATHROOMS have incredible views! To see the full video on this experience, plus my full trip, go to YouTube for Jillian Lawton 10-Minute Travel Tips: Taiwan."
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Family,First time to this restaurant. The location is first class and restaurant is supposed to be posh and classy. Is unfortunately like a snack bar. serving half pass 6 italian cuisine. The lousy atmosphere is cramp and badly furnished. This short coming however was compensated by the attentive staff and pleasant service. Otherwise my dinner expectations and experiences were ruined. The staffs save our evening. The fish was bad.
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"My wife and I decided to avoid the restaurants in our hotel and branch out. Great choice. Once we managed to get someone’s attention we enjoyed a lovely mean. Cost was £100 for two including service. The house wine was delicious as were the rocket salads, the ravioli, the steam and the hot chocolate puddings. Highly recommended."
Diamond Tony's 101 Authentic Italian Cuisine,2019-11-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"The restaurant charges for the view, not for the food. Supposedly an Italian restaurant, our options were 2 fixed-price menus with only one Italian option each. Definitely unacceptable."
Spice Market,2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Lots of Thai cuisines to choose from. Loved the Thai green papaya salad, lettuce wraps (shrimp, lamb and beef), soup section and shrimp pancake. The steak was remarkable. Overall the flavor was toned down to cater to Taiwanese taste. Would consider further visits."
Spice Market,2020-07-01T00:00:00Z,Family,really enjoyed the whole process. the food was fresh and the waiters are attending and super friendly. High recommended 推！食材新鮮 好吃。海鮮種類多 做法多元 非常新鮮，泰式料理也很豐富，蝦鬆好好吃 檸檬魚也讚，沙拉用的橄欖油是誠品有專櫃賣的法國進口高級橄欖油 有basil香味 很讚！ 服務人員態度非常好 又親切反應也快！ 很好的用餐經驗
Spice Market,2019-07-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"We ate here with some local friends and were impressed with the place as it was bustling and had a great display of food on offer. The food is mostly fresh seafood and salads with Thai food and desserts. The starter was the best because there was a really large selection of fresh cooked and raw seafood. I really enjoyed the cooked prawns and crabs and some salad but many of the foods such as raw shellfish was not my cup of tea. I would have liked to have seen some raw tuna and salmon but there wasn't any. For the main course the food is most Thai and Taiwanese. I am a big fan of Thai food so really looked forward to eating here. However, the choice was not great and I found the sauces of the tom yum and green curry to be a little disappointing and less spicy than I like. Also in the green chicken curry the pieces of chicken were large pieces that included the soft skin and gristle and bone when I prefer to have lean pieces of chicken so had to do a lot of fiddling around on my dish when eating. Desserts were alright, quite a good display, but mostly we ate ice cream ..... several portions. The drinks were self service in metal beakers and my favourite was the mango lassi, which had a hint of pineapple and coconut. My kids liked the Thai tea and kept going back for more. Our local friends had several plates of the fresh seafood and less of the Thai food. So in my opinion if you love to eat raw and cooked seafood then you can really enjoy this buffet, but it you are looking for traditional Thai food then perhaps this isn't the place to come. This is a really nice buffet restaurant and seemed to be very popular, fantastic for seafood and worth the visit."
Spice Market,2019-11-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"THIS THAI SEAFOOD BUFFET WAS FANTASTIC. What I liked about Spice Market Buffet: ✅Great selection of seafood, even on a weekday night (I imagine weekends would have an even larger selection)🦐. ✅Haagen Daaz Ice Cream Bar🍦. ✅All you can drink Iced Thai Milk Tea🍵. (And other complimentary drink selection). ✅Noodle bar 🍜. ✅Monday night dinner discounts for women (approx. $30CAD for women and $40CAD for men). Not sure if that's discrimination but I do love a good discount 😀. The food was fresh and tasted great. My only gripe was that the jumbo raw shrimp wasn't de-veined..."
Spice Market,2015-05-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Great food, but the seats are to closed together. Bad luck sat next to someone keep coughing and talk loud. Best go with your own group of friends with private table and area. 食物超讚， 座位很擠。倒楣坐在一直咳嗽還大聲談話的人旁邊。 最好跟一群朋友可以有自己的涼亭區獨立座位."
Spice Market,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,I have been dinning in this restaurant many many times. The food is delicious and fresh each time. Love the atmosphere and the service. Will be back !!
Spice Market,2019-03-01T00:00:00Z,Family,Crabs were not very tasty. The staffs are helpful. Dessert parts are good and tasty. Totally Not very valuable.
Spice Market,2017-11-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"It’s been more than 8 years since my last visit to this restaurant. This time round, I took a good friend of mine who has never been to this place for dinner. As always, we arrived with a big queue lined up to get on. Once we got in to the restaurant, we went round to see all the delicious food. Looks differ from my last visit, more Hot dishes than cold dishes. Anyhow, overall experience is good and good is standard. staffs are friendly and helpful, would definitely come back again in the near future."
Spice Market,2017-03-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Very fresh seafood, cooking food taste delicious, free flow beer and haagen dazs ice cream, fast and polite service. Wonderful buffet experience in Taipei."
Spice Market,2015-11-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"The food quality is excellent, and there is a decent amount of selection, however please be aware there are a lot of great dining options in Taiwan for less money. In the end you're really paying more for their rent than the overall quality of the buffet. The food and service is good, but I guess the overall value for price is questionable."
Spice Market,2021-04-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"The food is delicious, but the interior design could be better. The tables are too close, too crowded. The air flow isn't good either, makes one drowsy."
Spice Market,2020-04-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"the taste remain the same as usual, but due to the coronavirus impact, there are only few people dining in the restaurant, thankfully, the service is good as usual"
Spice Market,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,Good food! Amazing drinks and desserts too. Overall a good experience. Will come back to visit again.
Spice Market,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,It's well worth your money. Just make sure you arrive hungry. Reservation needed d/o the place is located in business district & people like the restaurant for its uniqueness & abundant of selection.
Spice Market,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"This place is great, they have a very wide variety of food. The seafood station is amazing and the desert station is great!"
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2024-12-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"To be honest with all of you, I made an absolutely outstanding experience there. Why? Let me put it this way: first I did not get ""discriminated"" to be only one person, so I got a place to go there alone. Plenty of other Michelin Star restaurants do not sell for one person only. Since this restaurant offers a high chair table looking towards the kitchen it is easy for them also to handle this request. Second: entering the restaurant getting a warm welcome from the concierge and saying your name immediately without telling him who you are is highly professional. Third: getting welcomed from a highly professional acting waiter but also the Sommelier who is joking with you on a level above cheap acting is really great, having good chats and making you feel well even you are alone. However and nevertheless, I do not think that I have to tell much about the dinner itself: it is 2 stars so it was simply perfect. Each single course cooked to perfection. For the dessert I had a very classic one: Tarte aux pommes, but in a very special way: multiple layers of apple slices, a little bit of butter.... - and so on, yes - you know what I mean. That Patissier is an artist. Excellent choice for me. As mentioned, I really loved these three hours staying there and I highly recommend to have a visit of this place for sure!"
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2022-02-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Try for a hot seat around the central show kitchen, so you can see your meal being expertly prepared by the team of chefs, before it is presented to you by the expert wait staff. The French cuisine is accompanied by wines from the extensive cellar. L'Atelier Joel Robuchon carries on the tradition of Chef Robuchon, who was said to be the best chef on the century. Sadly, he passed away in 2018, aged 73. This restaurant is said to be one of the best in Taipei."
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2022-02-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"The restaurant has a luxury interior design with a contemporary touch, colored mainly in red and black. Superb atmosphere and graceful fine dining experience. Breads, appetizers, main courses, deserts, …. each dish is unique and full of flavor. Delicious food and excellent service, deserving of two Michelin stars. Seats are hard to come by, especially table seats. Better to make a reservation some two months in advance."
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2020-10-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Joel Robuchon was named chef of the century. Among other dishes, his mashed potatoes were hailed as the world's best. His dishes are simple, but cooked perfectly. Taiwan people are prepared to pay for haute cuisine, but it must be said that the dishes at Joel Rubichon are relatively modest. Try the quail stuffed with foie gras (goose liver). Sadly, Chef Joel passed away at age 73 in 2018."
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2022-05-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"L'Atelier de Joel Rochuchon is following in the footsteps of Chef Joel Rochuchan, who was named Chef of the Century. The restaurant was awarded 2 Michelin stars. The restaurant specialises in classic French dishes such as Steak Tartare. The wine list is impressive. Service is excellent. By the way, booking is essential."
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2024-08-01T00:00:00Z,Business,"A perfect night to experience this legend The surroundings were perfectly very good and attentive service, took a little mixed but the meat was in simplistic to yourself A good sommelier rek. Good wines Super satisfied"
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2025-09-22T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"This is why never trust Michelin. This place must have purchased their stars from costco relatively to true 2 stars outside of Twn or in twn. Not Robuchon’s fault, I’d blame michelin. Food: for those of you who have been to true 1, and especially 2 stars else where, I suggest for you guys to bring a pillow. So boring, you will fall asleep. Not saying quality is poor, just very merrrr. BTW, first time seeing red/yellow bell peppers in a dish from michelin restaurant. Service: reaching across people and table to place / retrieve utensils multiple times…. need I say more? Ambience: well, with all the high chair and all, food court? High class food court."
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2020-06-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Cozy deco with signature robuchon red and black scheme, attentive service, delicious food. It’s fun sitting at the bar overlooking the kitchen. My favorite dish was the caviar with egg. The cod was flavorful, asparagus soup was rich, abalone was soft and tasty, mash potato so creamy. The uni dish was way too salty."
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2024-07-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,Joel Robuchon is my favourite restaurant however this time it was disappointing. The food was average however Dover sole was was delicious. Service was poor and not what I expected from a michelin star restaurant with such high standards.
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2013-11-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"At the night my family dinned at the restaurant there were an elderly couple and a young couple with kids sitting in the next table. The waitresses were very accommodating, turning the whole night into a major baby sitting event. The kids screamed and cried as babies would, so the 4 adults took turns walking around our table trying to calm the kids down. Because of the kids drew all the attention, no one cared if we needed water or anything else. Often we are ignored even when our hands are raised. Not to mention due to the screaming I could barely talk to the person sitting next to me. The food was fine, but the whole dinning experience was disastrous. For the price I paid, I'd expect a bit more from this place."
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2013-12-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"The genius of Joel Robuchon is that he took the classic French cooking that he grew up with and reinvented it for the modern age. He created a mash up of a sushi counter with a tapas bar and added sleek, cool design and the L'Atelier concept was born: Small portions of intensely flavoured food that are somehow reminiscent of the past, yet ultra-modern. The decor is all black and red and chrome, with high chairs and a long counter. The chefs work in an open kitchen and have direct contact with the customers. For me this is foodie heaven. For others maybe less so - perhaps that explains some of the strange negative reviews here. If you love food, then ignore these people and go. Soon. It is expensive of course although the set lunch and dinner menu's are good value. The kind of ingredients they use don't come cheap and this level of quality doesn't either. Expect to pay upwards of NT$ 4-6000 a person, more if you splash out on their speciality Sea Urchin dish - which I highly recommend! Olivier Jean is the new chef here. He came from L'Atelier Etoile in Paris and he brings the same relentless focus on quality that all Robuchon protégés have. They are never quite satisfied with how things are and always looking to improve. The food is excellent, at least as good as L'Atelier in Paris (which has 2 Michelin Stars) and better than London IMHO. What's different here is that it is all a little less formal, a little less stiff, and I found I enjoyed it more. The staff were wonderful, a great balance of effortless professionalism and a playful sense of fun. If you are someone that loves to eat. Someone for whom a meal is an occasion to be celebrated. Someone who appreciates the skill and commitment of a great chef, then I highly recommend you go here. You won't regret it."
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2016-10-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"I brought a newly wed couple friends of mine to try out the restaurant and we left with unforgettable memories of the good food and services. From starters (we had 2 which came with the set) to main (I had saffron infused risotto and a meat dish of beef), they are executed to perfection. Dessert was passion fruit topped with cream to cap off the sweet finish to our perfect meal."
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2015-02-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"I heard this one is the least expensive among all Robuchon chain. Thus if you wanted to pay less for the same experience, you should visit taipei branch. It situated in a very nice building. The look is standard. Dark with stylish furniture. We went for lunch over Chinese New Year. Restaurant didn't charge more instead they just pulled the cheapest lunch set out of their menu. For 2880 NT, you can have two appetizers and two main course. Desert, coffee were also included. We found the portion of food quite generous. Over all the dishes are good. Waiters are very attentive. I love my fried fish and roasted chicken. You may not think its value for money but theres at least no complaint. The place was fully booked that day to our surprise. Which means its well loved by many."
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2014-10-01T00:00:00Z,Business,"I love the Joël Robuchon bar seating concept where, as a lone traveller, I am able to interact with the waiters, the sommelier and the chef whilst watching the kitchen at work. The restaurant's dark black and red interior seemed warmly inviting and the kitchen the true heart of the restaurant. I chose the menu devouverte and every dish was without fail a true success. An amuse bouche of foie gras mousse with port sauce and parmesan foam was rich, unctuous and surprisingly light. What a lovely way to start a meal! A caviar first course was an interesting little tin of caviar over a crab and lobster mouse with a lovely gelée of I think apple and chill. Lovely yet subtle with the little pops of caviar acting almost to tantalise the tastebuds. A second course of girolles served with crispy ravioli and onion foam was a wonderful way to show case the fantastic girolles. The mushrooms were beautifully cooked and the foam and accompanying sauce played off the rich earthiness of the mushrooms to superb effect. A third course of pan fried foie gras, I was almost dreading. Most restaurants either choose bad quality foie gras or simply over cook the foie gras leaving it moist and revealing the underlying liver taste. This was quite the opposite. The foie gras was perfection and complimented beautifully by little stewed grapes and lovely blueberry sauce whose combined bitter and sweet tastes left much thought as I was eating this course. A fourth course of maine lobster with seasonable vegetables and lobster bisque was beautifully cooked. The lobster was sweet and rich and the accompanying lobster bisque was velvety and surprisingly light. A fifth course of John Dory consisted of a beautifully cooked piece of fish surrounded in a beautifully sophisticated saffron and clam sauce. The accompanying cabbage and kale was a fantastic use of two very much maligned vegetables. A sixth course of quail stuffed with foie gras with mashed potato was an exquisitely presented dish. The quail was matched in flavour by the beautiful mashed potato which was quite simply one of the silkiest, smoothest and creamiest mashed potatoes I have ever eaten. The quail itself was beautiful and gamey. However a special mention must be given to the accompanying herb salad which both complimented the beautifully cooked meat and added an intensity and complexity to the mashed potato. Looking round the restaurant the alternative main course of hanger steak with shishito and bell peppers must get a mention - it looked fantastic and I shall have to try it next time. A seventh course of pineapple served in several ways was a fantastic palate cleanser and was a great preparation for an eight course consisting of a simply beautiful mango cake that was a nice light way to complete the meal. I would say that it was disappointing that there were no half bottles and the list of wine by the glass was small. However, the wine list itself is well conceived an I enjoyed a wonderful white chateauneuf du pale whose complexity and age complimented this simply fantastic meal."
L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon,2013-11-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"I have been to Robuchon Taipei dozens of times and it never disappointed, while I am not familiar with the new chef the system is quite solid and ensures consistent quality. Strongly recommend for anyone looking for genuine french cuisine in Taipei and to be serviced by the best sommelier in town. Quite surprised by the review above ""French cuisine?????"" but maybe that can be explained by 75% of reviews by this person getting 1 star :)"
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2024-01-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Located on the Grand Hyatt's third floor, Irodori is the hotel's second buffet restaurant after the large and very popular ground floor Café. Unlike the Café, Irodori only serves lunch and dinner and focuses on Japanese seafood in a more intimate, but also very popular, space. Prices are higher on weekends, and a good variety of sake is offered. To my Asian but Western eye, many of the dishes were unfamiliar and a bit exotic to me, but nevertheless beautifully presented. Some of the more familiar offerings (such as sushi/sashimi) I also saw at the Café, but Irodori is slightly less expensive. The 2 types of small whole crabs looked gorgeous and were tasty, but messy. Service was excellent. There are restrooms in the restaurant. A great lunch."
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2023-02-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,Irodori is the Grand Hyatt Taipei's up-market Japanese restaurant. It's a superior dining venue for Japanese and Taiwan businesspeople. Irodori serves a wide range of Japanese cuisine. The restaurant provides a place for socializing. Menu and service are superb.
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2020-03-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"I came here for lunch last month and took advantage of their promotion via online booking. Nice seating arrangement (nice decor and partitions into different areas for privacy) and prompt service. And not crowded like other buffet restaurants. Food quality wise, it was mostly very good. The types of crab they had there did not yield a lot of meat. Basic selection of sashimi and sushi freshly made by the chef. Actually they have chef stations for sashimi/sushi, grill, tempura and teppanyaki, even the special ""taiyaki"" dessert, so food never sits there for too long. For me, the highlights were their beef steak cubes and many of their grill items. Price wise, I can't say it's worth the original price. But if they have promotional discounts, then I can recommend giving it a try."
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"I've recently become a frequent guest of the Grand Hyatt Taipei, itself a very good hotel. I've tried several of the hotel restaurants, and as I love Japanese food (am half-Japanese, can cook Japanese, and my wife and I often travel to Japan for a foodie trip), thought I'd give the Irodori Grand Hyatt a try. To be fair, it's a Japanese buffet, so I set my expectations accordingly, but even so, was generally disappointed - in the food, the ambience, and the waitstaff. Taipei certianly has some good buffet restaurants, but at over USD$52.00 for lunch, Irodori is way over-priced for the low-quality of food overall. It all looks great, but the fish for sushi/sashimi are cheap cuts, very little color, no taste. The noodle bar could be great, but it wasn't, they didn't even have the essentials to make a bowl of Japanese-style Ramen. I tried the Soba and Udon, both over-cooked and mushy. The broths had no depth. The limited Yakitori selection was over-cooked and dry. The Chawan Mushi was too stiff. Oddly enough for an Asian restaurant, though they had a variety of prepared rice dishes, no plain white rice was on the buffet line. I had to ask for it, by the time it arrived, pretty much everything I had that was a hot dish wasn't any more. The restaurant is very noisy, not somplace to enjoy a leisurely or relaxed meal. What annoyed me more than anything was being watched and treated like I was going to dine and dash without paying my bill. I was asked my room number when I sat down. I was twice told that I must ask for my bill before leaving. Adding insult to injury, my bill was presented before I was done, without my asking and the waitress stood there until I had signed it. Over-priced, only average food, waitstaff that stalk you, noisy, I won't be back. And please note, the other buffet restarurant in the hotel is a good value, with excellent service."
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2021-02-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"Even though we were arranged to a normal table instead of a quiet one, the overall food quality and services are excellent. We enjoyed the experience so much."
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2020-12-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"It was an ideal place for meet up with friends. Choices may not be as wide, but the quality was very good. We were planning to go back again soon."
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2018-03-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Some of the reviews mention it gets busy - this is true early on but it does get quiter later on if like me you don't reserve and you want to dine. Food is really high quality, cooked fresh frequently. Excellent choice and I guarantee you will eat far more than you need. Service was excellent as well, dishes made to order as they had run out. My only suggestion, have a diet soda in the buffet as well as the full sugar variety."
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2017-04-01T00:00:00Z,Business,"great breakfast buffet for $30. so many stations and selections, but definitely worth the money. All that's missing is a mimosa! :)"
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2017-04-01T00:00:00Z,Business,So nice of selection of Japanese foods all in buffer style. it is very high quality and need to be booked in advance.
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2016-10-01T00:00:00Z,Not Identified,"For the price, i can enjoy the full range of Japanese food and unlimited sashimi. Booking has to be done in advance, otherwise, you might not get a seat if you have a group coming in."
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2016-04-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"In my opinion there are better Japanese restaurants in Taipei. The sashimi and sushi dishes were high quality, but I am sad to say that the other food in the buffet did not set the standards I would expect from a restaurant in this price bracket."
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Seating was not extraordinary, nor was food presentation. However, we enjoyed a good range Japanese buffet spread, including the usual suspects: fresh sashimi, sushi and maki, chawanmushi, soup, tempura, grilled selection, soba, ice cream, pastry desserts. Buffet include hot tea throughout and a coffee to finish off. Service was friendly and helpful."
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2015-11-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"We decided to try something new & ended up here. Plus we were suffering from major jet lag and didn't want to go out of the hotel!! We were there for about an hour when we realized we were the only non Asian people in this restaurant . We tried almost everything off this extensive buffet. Glad we did it, it was interesting & fun. Great service!!! Lots of good tea!"
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2015-08-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Irodori is one of my favourite buffet restaurant in Taipei. With regard to their service, it's not that good as other restaurants within Hyatt Taipei, but still acceptable. All in all, the food is fresh and delicious. For dessert part, I will highly recommend you should try their Japanese dessert such as 今川焼き first instead of regular chocolate cakes!"
Irodori Grand Hyatt Taipei,2014-12-01T00:00:00Z,Business,"Got free diner as part of room deal, being that this restaurant is located at the Grand Hyatt which is simply superb, shock of terrible food, ignorant and disinterested service and horrible disgusting presentation made me feel that I should have been paid by wasting my time and hunger Avoid it even if it's free, maybe the hotel is on to something and that's the reason they give it away Will I go again? rather stick needles in my eyes"
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2025-12-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Lack of cleanliness is very off putting. Looked unhygienic, nothing like the photos on one website. Short of staff, only 3 staff members, including the chef and waiter, one of whom threw something on the floor in anger, not sure if it was directed at customer or colleague."
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2024-04-01T00:00:00Z,Family,A good place to get authentic Indian food. A lot of selections for foods as well as drinks. The spicy level here can be requested to your level of spicy tolerences. Good and friendly service.
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2025-11-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,Wasn’t intending to have a curry but couldn’t find the place i was looking for but went in here. Full of people on arrival but may have been a bus given a bus group arrived just as l left. Friendly efficient service and delicious food but pricey. Paid aud$80 for something that would have cost around $50 at home…worth it? Not sure
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2024-04-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"I have visited Taipei many times and tried all kinds of restaurants.I pick this restaurant because it is ranked number one in Trip Advisor. I have to tell you it is disappointment. We walked in with only one table with guess. Ambience just usual. Someone move one table aside and was cleaning the floor while we are eating. Service was bad. Four people standing in the front but only one working. The other three were chatting. The one that serve us cannot speak either good Chinese or good English. The food was just ok, I had better Indian food in many other countries. Although the price was reasonable. We all wonder how it can be number one ranking in TA. There are far more better restaurants in Taipei."
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2025-12-01T00:00:00Z,Family,Usually my go to place in Taipei for Indian I have had many great meals here... But earlier this week there was something off. The tandoori chicken had a fishy taste - did the chef not clean the pan - I don't know. The Pani Puri was tasteless don't order it. The curry and Naan were good.
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2024-04-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"This restaurant has an excellent range of menus catering for all food requirements - meat lovers and vegetarians , families with young children and everyone of all ages. The service is a great with staff from all over the world speaking many languages. Easy to Get to and importantly open all day for lunch. Must try Indian restaurant in Taipei"
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2025-09-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"The restaurant was super close to my hotel and it was getting later for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place was quite empty, so naturally the service was excellent. The Tandoori Butter Chicken was amazing. Great amount of spiciness. Only downside is it's a bit more expensive than the other restaurants around the area. But for sure will be heading back again before i leave Taipei."
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2024-04-01T00:00:00Z,Business,One of the best indian restaurant in Taiwan. Amazing food and a very friendly staff. Must try- Chicken tikka. The flavour was better than many restaurants in India. Also the samosas are authentic and not those frozen ones u get everywhere. A must visit for Indian food lovers.
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2025-05-01T00:00:00Z,Family,Great Indian food I have ever had. Delicious dishes. I love it. I will recommend this restaurant to friends.
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2024-05-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Of all the Indian restaurants that I have visited outside of India, this one wins hands down. Starting with the courteous welcome along with papad to the dishes it was a feast of genuine Indian spices. Though I only tried aloo gobhi and mushroom mutter, I thought these were done superbly. Served in good quantities too. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try genuine Indian food in Taiwan. Nice ambience, superb hosts, Indian food does the magic."
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2024-03-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"We ordered the v. Samosa and chili paneer to start with and both were very good. Then had the chicken vindaloo, paneer tikka masala, and creamy malia tikka for entrees - all were fantastic. No room for dessert but we will be back."
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2024-04-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Me and my family of 8 went by this Indian restaurant and thought why not give it a try. We had fish, shrimp and lamb curry. It was fantastic!! Wasn't too spicy yet it the scent of the herbs were so good! We especially loved their milk tea!!!! It has some ginger and peppermint flavor along with the milk tea. We love it here!!!!"
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2025-10-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"This is my first time to try the Indian good in Taipei, the taste is good, and it is special too, I can have a nice dinner with my friend!😉 Cheers!"
Mayur Indian Kitchen,2024-04-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"I've been to India before, and the food here made me feel like having dinner there again. If you're a fan of Indian cuisine, you have to come here and have a try."
Haidilao Taiwan,2024-03-01T00:00:00Z,Family,Best hotpot near Taipei 101. Service is amazing and you can get a free manicure while waiting. You order on an iPad and staff check back frequently. Pro tip: put your name in and go shopping — they give you a QR code to track your place in line.
Haidilao Taiwan,2019-11-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Wonderful first experience at Haidilao ATT4FUN. Service was outstanding and food came quickly. Soup bases were excellent, especially mala and pork innards. Hand-pulled noodles were entertaining. Not cheap but very memorable."
Haidilao Taiwan,2019-04-01T00:00:00Z,Family,Great meal with excellent service and two soup choices in one pot. Free fruit and an entertaining face-mask changing show made the experience memorable.
Haidilao Taiwan,2016-09-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Celebrated a birthday here and was blown away by the service. Everything was thoughtfully considered, making a good restaurant into a great one. No wonder people queue for hours."
Haidilao Taiwan,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Friendly service with hand-pulled noodles and face-mask shows. Entertainment stood out more than the food quality, though soups and sauces were decent."

Haidilao Taiwan,2019-04-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Fast service, friendly staff, and huge variety of hotpot items. Enjoyed noodle and mask-changing shows. A must-see when visiting Taipei."
Haidilao Taiwan,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,Business,Great place for group dinners. Fun shared dining experience with noodle and mask shows. Food was good and pricing fair.

Haidilao Taiwan,2018-04-01T00:00:00Z,Family,Very showy restaurant. Entertainment was strong but food was average and expensive.
Haidilao Taiwan,2018-03-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,Excellent food and top-notch service. Individual pots helped reduce cost. Fresh ingredients and attentive staff made it worth the wait.

Haidilao Taiwan,2017-03-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Fun, family-friendly hotpot with great entertainment and high-quality food."
Haidilao Taiwan,2017-03-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,Decent hotpot but long wait and overhyped. Service experience was disappointing for the reviewer.

Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2025-09-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"A quick lunch at ichiran main store on the basement level been to plenty ichirans in japan but had to try and compare to the one here in taiwan as my kid loves the ramen and atmosphere of ichiran after hes visit to japan.
Opens at 10am very easy to find from the outside with a sign chained up the front near the stairs below
Went about 11:30am and was about 8 people infront inline with moved fast after filling out our desired textures for the ramen and was seated in our 2 cubicles in about 15-ish minutes..
Very clean inside and plenty of seating from looking around think i seen roughly 3 different sections of seating.
Meal was ready and placed just under 5 minutes from the order sheet getting taken.
Cause you pick your own toppings and softness ect: it comes down to your taste then and im still trying to nail the perfect tonkatsu flavour for my tastbuds but again happy with what i got but i shouldve went a bit stronger but the noodles were perfect for my softness chosen.
Kid loved hes ramen and was happy with hes and extra pork provided by me.
Gift shop of ichiran noodle packs on offer just before paying did get the 2 pack instead of the usual 5 packs as the price difference between japan and taiwan is about double which i couldnt justify paying knowing its cheaper.
Again the ramen prices for our meal are double plus from japan i reckon and cost for two ramens a 2 pack and the extra pork/egg was around 1300TWD/$71AUD which other then a tourist trap and a kids faviroute i wouldnt go out of my way to come back when other places are better at a fraction of the price over asia but the serentity of eating in quiet stalls is always good"
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2025-04-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"We had heard stories about this restaurant prior to coming to Taipei and we were determined to try it for ourselves. This resulted in an amazing lunch that's recommended to anyone interested in different travel experiences. Firstly there is the line to enter, do not let it deter you as it moves quickly. You complete the order form ready for when you are taken to an individual cubical. Pass the completed order form to the noodle chef who will then prepare your fresh ramen bowl as ordered. The bowing from the chef is a nice touch. The meal was brilliant, and this was a fantastic experience that we will repeat on our next trip to Taipei."
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2024-05-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"I have to say that even here in Taipei (apart from Shibuya and Dotonburi that I've tried) has a long queue when dining. Almost the same Ichiran dining experience feels, only in Taipei, not in Japan."
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2024-11-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Wonderful food!! The lines are long, but the Ramen is so worth it. It's a must try place! I eat here every time I'm in Taipei"
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2023-07-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"We enjoyed the ramen. Other than the 2 hours waiting time, the rest of the experience was splendid ☺️

Get a Q number, do not lose it. You can proceed elsewhere while waiting and check the Q status from your phone. Once number is near, go back to shop, show your Q number and get ready for your Ichiran experience 😋"
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2023-11-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Terrible and child unfriendly . We were walking past when we were ushered in, and was told that a kid's meal would be provided , however after ordering and finishing our own meal , the kids meal hasn't arrived yet. It was only after inquiring did they tell us we were ineligible because we were tourist ,which was not at all mentioned to us beforehand. As you can see, the child is just sitting here in the kids chair , anticipating to eat with the bib on, but blatantly denied the meal."
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2022-02-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"We come very often. It is the same ramen as what we can get in Japan. The broth, ramen, spice, pork slice, green onion, seaweed and soft heart egg also steamed rice are all the same, delicious & unforgetable."
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2020-05-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"We come quite often because it is very authentic & very delicious. It isn’t easy to bring the authenticity to go abroad but it does. The noodle is great, the broth is delicious, the thin BBQ pork is yummy & seaweed, soft yolk egg and extra ordered chopped green onion bring the whole ramen experience a perfect one."
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Came over to the Ichiran at Taipei because I could not get it back at Singapore. I must really say I am impressed with the concept as well as how consistent the taste were.

I tried quite a few outlets at Hong Kong, Japan and now Taiwan and the taste has been the same. Maybe to give some tips for diners is that now they are very high tech, you can just get a queue number first and then you can monitor the queue status via your phone, once you are about 10-20 numbers away you can start making your way back to the Ichiran shop and the waiting time should be pretty fast.

If they ever ask you if you are okay to split, just say yes as you will be dining on your personal space anyway!

Overall, must drop by if you have the time! But if you want to get your local Taiwanese food fix, and you have basically tried Ichiran before, this can be skipped."
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,Business,"I am at the Grand Hyatt Taipei on business and had a craving for ramen. It’s January and a bit chilly in Taipei and some hot delicious soup sounded really good. I went in search of a ramen spot in ATT but wasn’t impressed with my findings. I saw Ichiran listed as a nearby ramen spot and thought I’d give it a try. You know you are into something when you walk up and there’s a line and a restaurant worker outside checking people in. I waited for about 10 minutes and then was seated in an individual booth. By the way, all of the booths are for solos so it turned out to be the perfect spot for this lone traveler. Coming from the US, this is an experience. A special and memorable moment unlike typical food experiences I’m used to. But the best part is that the food actually matches the hype - the line, the folks taking selfies, the thousands of reviews on Google. It is indeed worth it. The most delicious ramen broth I’ve had. I’m no expert on ramen but I do like good food and have had many ramen bowls over my lifetime. It’s clear this stuff is special and in a league of its own. Definitely worth a visit."
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2020-12-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Long line here on a Saturday afternoon, was told to wait for 2 hours but you can sit outside and enjoy the Taipei 101 view from afar. Even if you don’t wish to wait there, they provide a QR code on the ticket paper that you can scan and check the queue number. Once you’re inside you sit in these solo-booths and they serve you from this small wooden window. I quite liked this concept and it was nice to see something different like this. The food is great, we enjoyed the ramen although I haven’t tried the restaurant in Japan so I can’t make comparisons. However everything was just nice for me and I really enjoyed it."
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,Taste just exactly like the one in Tokyo. All of us love it and have additional egg and the meat on the side. The soup is just remarkable.
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2019-11-01T00:00:00Z,Family,Nice ramen broth with thin tender pork slices. Up your spice level. Good first experience eating in own booth but rather expensive as not table seating with service. Recommended to try if not too long queue.
Ichiran Ramen Taiwan,2019-11-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Have tried the Ichiran in Japan (Osaka and Nagoya). Wasn't disappointed. Atmosphere is similar, food just as good except find the ramen slightly overcooked. But still enjoyed very much. Satisfied."
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2023-09-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,The dedicated tableside service staff was kind and professional. She also remembered the last time I had a meal here. The single bottle of red wine she recommended was also very good. The food recommendations were also great. The food tasted very good and the overall dining experience was great.
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2020-04-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"The main objective for this lunch was the prime rib and to that topic specifically it was great. Lawry's of course is an established establishment and the quality of food will always be steady in terms of the meat. But, I must say the starter courses are far below what I expected, and to be honest, I wasn't expecting much.

The soup was way too salty (beef vegetable soup), the crab cakes lacked flavor and the ""greens"" underneath the crab cakes were shriveled and wet (probably not stored properly?), lawry's spinning salad is normal cant mess up sauce that comes in a bottle.

All in all, the meat is good, for the first serving go for the thickest cut, but since after the first serving every serving after the rarity of the meat can not be chosen, it will come out as medium or more, so I would suggest to get the 7.5oz thin cuts."
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2020-11-01T00:00:00Z,Family,Prime rib was extra delicious that day. It was cooked well for medium rare thin or with bone. We had a lovely romantic night except for a few baby crying and kids wondering around events.
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2025-02-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"The price and the meal, the atmosphere, the service are not equal to the American restaurant experience

1. Beverage before meals: The texture of sweet roots and vegetable juice is not fine enough, and the taste is slightly rough.
2. Salad: Selected vegetables are common, sauce flavor is flat, can not stimulate appetite.
3. Soup and front dishes: the taste of mushroom sauce is still good, but light, lack of level feeling; Hokkaido dried beet size is small, taste is normal, and expectations differ, it is not recommended to select.
4. Main meal - ribs: Although the portion is full and the visual effect is good, but when the actual taste, after removing fat meat, many parts are still resilient, even if you choose three-point cooking, the meat has not reached the expected softness, chewing is very hard.
5. Main meal - Boston shrimp: The appearance is refined, but the shrimp meat is old, the taste is ordinary, and the overall taste is not in proportion to its high price.
6. Drinks and desserts: moderate performance, no impressive highlights.
7. Service and atmosphere: The restaurant's service and overall atmosphere are the most amazing part of this dining experience. Since this is our first visit, booking time is 13:30 and arrival is on time. During the meal, the servant's dish fell in awe, and the dish was filled with fragments. After the main meal was finished, it was only 15: 00, the servant began to accelerate the checkout in an implicit manner, and the overall meal time was urgent and bad.

In summary, according to the standards of international American luxury restaurants, the Taipei Shinjuku restaurant still has considerable room for progress in the communication skills of the staff, crisis handling, attitude to service and the quality of meals, so that it can match its pricing."
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2020-08-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"The overall quality of the food is lower than before and the service at times was not great. Food wise our appetizers were cold when we got them, the taste was okay but being that it was a hot appetizer you would expect it to be warm at least. The french onion soup used cheddar cheese which made it felt cheap and when we saw it i was a bit surprised and confirmed it was cheddar cheese which beforw it wasn’t. The taste def was affected by it. The prime rib is still the star of the mean but lawry’s sides are always a highlight but I was disappointed in the quality of the sides, either just on the warm side and the taste def was not as great compared to before. Service, they were rushing every course which at one point got really annoying I was eating my salad and had the fork in my hand and my waiter came over and asked if he can take it away. We were stunned and I had to tell him it is very obvious i am still eating. I felt the meal was rushed and i cudnt even enjoy my conversations with my friends bc they wud just randomly interrupt without caring that we were in the middle of a conversation. I hope with the move to bellavita in oct they will re-raise the quality."
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2023-08-01T00:00:00Z,Family,The restaurant is located inside the Dame Department Store. It has convenient parking and is close to the MRT City Hall. The decoration design style is high-end and the atmosphere is very suitable for celebrations. High-quality ingredients and good service attitude
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"The service was good and the waiters were very nice, went there for 6 months anniversary and they had a cake prepared for us also sang a song. in the end they made us a hand made card. overall it was a good experience finding there."
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2022-07-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"My first time I am visiting this restaurant. ""Price is what you pay. Value is what you get"" (Warren Buffet). The quality of the service, the coziness of the room, and the excellency of the food are what I experienced during the meal. You will feel this whenever you are (in Taiwan, US, or Singapore). Great and congrats to all..."
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2024-12-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"The elegant environment is suitable for parties with children
The service staff is nice and very careful
Enjoy great meals for adults and children
The furnace meat makes eating a very double group of people
All to meet their own preferences"
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2016-05-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"I like to give some sort of positive review if possible whenever I visit somewhere and enjoy at least some part of the meal.
Unfortunately last night at Lawry's didn't have very much positive to talk about.
We arrive a little after 8pm for dinner and were told before we were seated there was no more prime rib but we could order anything else on the menu.
Odd. No prime rib at a prime rib restaurant?
Hmmmm.
But we decide to venture in anyway. Mistake.
We order steaks.
Then we noticed the prime rib serving cart was still making rounds through the restaurant, happily serving prime rib to hungry patrons.
When our dinner was served, my Wagyu steak ordered medium came to the table almost bleeding rare. I had to send it back.
My friend's aged steak came out looking like a flat iron steak and wasn't cooked right either.
It should also be noted the restaurant was only about 10% full. Far more open tables than full.
At this point we were feeling like this was a hidden camera gag on us because the prime rib serving cart was still in motion, serving everyone else in the restaurant except us.
We sat in amazed confusion as this just kept on happening at the few tables near us.
Then, the manager approaches our table and inquires if our steaks will be enough food because, TA DA!! there is still prime rib available, and would we like some?
Really? Unbelievable.
We told the manager to please walk away from us so we could stew in stunned silence at what had just happened.
At this point we felt it would be best to ramble on so we asked for our check and again we were sadly surprised to see not a single item had been taken off them tab, no concessions of poor service or our bad experience.
Paid the bill and swore off Lawry's forever.
I will never return."
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2016-06-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"First impression is woah! Friendly and sophisticated serving, pleasant ambiance, clean and neat, but unfortunately the compliments end here. I was rather disappointed afterwards.
""The famous spinning salad"", seriously? Nothing but a cheap show off and you end up with a basic tasteless salad. The roasted beef was nicely done but a bit fatty for my taste."
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2012-12-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"The food and service were good as usual. There were lots of birthday and anniversary celebrations around us, so it might be a good idea to place business luncheon away from celebration parties."
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2015-11-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"The Lawry's prime Rib (raost beef) was alright. The spinning salad was a gimmick. Tasted alright, but silly or touristy. Quality didn't match the price. The mashed potatoes were flavorless. Almost tasted like powdered potatoes. The creamed corn or whatever it was, was also flavorless and slightly awful, tasted very unhealthy, I mean what is it? Then the Lawry's fllavored shaker pepper and salt?! Oh my, at a fancy restaurant they have that crap. Iodine salt? No fluer de sel. No pepper grinder mill. With the service and price there should have been someone with a long pepper mill grinding for me and some special gourmet salt. They try to be high-end but they look low class with those stupid shakers on the table. Ya think they could make some new labeling looking gourmet or tasteful."
Lawry s The Prime Rib,2011-08-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Food is ok, but the price performance is not that good~"
Din Tai Fung,2023-10-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Din Tai Fung is a culinary masterpiece! From the first bite of their legendary dumplings to the flavorful Dan Dan Noodles, every dish is a taste sensation. Impeccable service and a warm ambiance make this spot a must-visit for food lovers. In a word: exceptional!"
Din Tai Fung,2018-12-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"It's what you expect. A lot of tourists and if you unlucky, the waiting time can be real long. So the food is totally good and enjoy it. Some of the things is really hot so don't burn yourself. The one with truffle is my favorite and i always go for this dish..."
Din Tai Fung,0208-09-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"This is the original restaurant at yongkang street. It has more ambience since the look and furniture are original when they opened. Like the other branches, it’s a wait during all hours , and a long wait during peak hours"
Din Tai Fung,2018-07-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Stumbled across this place when I investigated why there was a big crowd of people. There was a long wait, but as a single I was sat right away. The menu is big, prices are very reasonable for a Michelin star rated restaurant. Staff was great. Food was on outstanding. Not sure if you could about d let new if you were in a group, but it was an excellent experience."
Din Tai Fung,2018-05-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Reservations were made by Taipei friends, who ordered all the courses. Excellent service, delicious food. Excellent acoustics in the room, so conversation easy."
Din Tai Fung,2018-06-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"A few branches in taipei and the irony is there are more branches overseas Besides the famous dumplings, the chicken/wine appetiser, chicken soup are also good Service is excellent"
Din Tai Fung,2018-04-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Xialong Bao, Xialong Bao, Xialong Bao!!! Theo only thing that constantly comes back to me is Xialong Bao at at Din Tai Fung. Reviewers compliments other restaurants and said some to be better than Din Tai Fung but I disagreed. We tried at least 4 other top rated restaurants from budget to mid range pricing, but did not any that actually matched Din Tai Fung's Xialong Bao. The service was very good too. The waitresses really took care of us as we went from one dish to another in confusion. Din Tai Fung would still be our first choice next time."
Din Tai Fung,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"When I think of Taiwan I always think of xiao long bao. This place is a perfect machine for these things. The workers work with precision, like intense robots. The service is fine, but the server was rushing and spilled beer on my LV bag and myself, but more than made up for it by the apology, a free beer, some pineapple cake, and dessert bao. The food is actually really delicious and the xiao long bao are to die for!"
Din Tai Fung,2017-12-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Probably going to be the next export thing from Taiwain to the world. Already in China and Australia. The food and setup is great. If kitchen labor cost would be as favorable in the western world I guess it would be the next, and healthier, McD."
Din Tai Fung,2017-11-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"This has to be on anyone who visits Taipei, just so you can see for yourself if they truly are the best dumplings in Taiwan. For me, another restaurant took that title, but Din Tai Fung was still excellent. A bonus is that we arrived at 8 and the two of us did not need to queue, because we were willing to share a table upstairs. Pork Xiao long bao, prawn chilli dumplings, prawn dumplings, braised pork and noodles, and water spinach. All delicious and mouthwatering. Complimentary green tea is provided, which is a nice touch. Bill came to 1300 NTD all in for 2 which is excellent value for the quality."
Din Tai Fung,2017-05-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,A little expensive for a foodie who loves street food but worth a try especially their xiao long bao.
Din Tai Fung,2017-07-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Yes, Din Tai Fung has overseas branches but I think it is more authentic to have Din Tai Fung in Taipei. I have had all the Din Tai Fung quotas before leaving Taipei."
Din Tai Fung,2017-05-01T00:00:00Z,Family,Good restaurant and the dumplings don't have a overwhelming taste at the same time packs the flavor. However they need to accept credit card like other stores
Din Tai Fung,2017-05-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"And it's because the food is always high quality and delicious. Even though it's a chain, it's well worth going to any of the branches, and while there are plenty of other places for xiao ling bao, the restaurant chain is justifiably renowned."
Inparadise,2025-04-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Came here in the afternoon tea setting. For my money, luxury Chinese food doesn't get much better than this place. The photos speak for themselves. Unlimited sushi with varieties like botan ebi, wagyu, hokkaido scallop, and king salmon, what else can one ask for? (ok maybe hamachi). The lamb chops, tiger shrimps grilled/tempura/garlic fried were all absolutely amazing. Having chawanmushi done inside a whole egg shell topped with salmon roe is not just flavorful but also like a work of art. The clam chowder with a super crunchy pastry on top was my choice of seconds, while the peking duck also didn't disappoint (I had a full sized leg to myself!) The dessert section looked like a fancy pastry shop from Paris, while the drinks section featured many exclusive alcohol and tea, of which I favored a rose oolong tea. Just by writing this review I feel the need to go back again!"
Inparadise,2024-04-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Excellent variety of choices, a five-star dining experience where most of the stations were staffed, and courses made fresh on the spot, rather than the typical heat-lamps. Seafood steamed in front of you, hand rolls made to order, souffles fresh out of the oven, more choices than we had a stomach for! Beautiful views and atmospheres high atop the Breeze Building. Attentive staff and enough variety for anyone. The experience defies description. I found this to be the best anywhere I've had on the planet."
Inparadise,2024-05-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Food was mediocre, view was amazing, good drink options (moonlight and starry night), reservations are a must and sometimes difficult to get. Have your hotel or a friend assist in booking, I emailed them and was able to get reservations. Otherwise just a one time hit, won't be coming back."
Inparadise,2023-12-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Had a great 2023 Holiday dinner at Inparadise. The buffet itself took up the entire floor of the building. It spanned 360 degrees. A diverse range of food stations - examples included: raw/sushi, seafood, steam table, grill, desserts, etc. Definitely a focus on seafood but lots of other options as well. The sushi station was of higher quality than your typical buffet."
Inparadise,2024-02-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"The food is very diverse and delicious, and the environment is also very good. Although the price is not cheap, the CP value is very high, even better than the buffets in many five-star hotels. I come here often if I have the opportunity."
Inparadise,2023-05-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"Food is really a BUFFET ceiling. I have eaten at many places, but the dishes are really rich. There are so many choices and almost none of them are Lei’s meals. Moreover, you can see the night view of Taipei City by the window. This quality is perfect!! The only drawback is that it's really hard to locate and the phone calls often don't go through."
Inparadise,2023-06-01T00:00:00Z,Business,The food was excellent. The decor is basic and serve its purpose. Great view. Great value for the food and experience. Overall rating 4.0 out of 5.0 comparing to other global world class buffets. 5.0 rating buffets are Bacchanal and Wynn at Las Vegas.
Inparadise,2023-03-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,LOVELY VIEW ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS ON A 64TH FLOOR. DIFFICULT TO MAKE A BOOKING AS I WAS TOLD THAT THEY ARE ALWAY FULLY BOOKED
Inparadise,2020-11-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"Great selection, quality, view at a reasonable price. One of the best high end buffet in Taipei. Great for family or with friends. To try."
Inparadise,2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"We had a great time the first day after we arrived after a long flight to Taiwan. We booked about a month ahead and were able to get window seats. The staff was very courteus, the food delicious with about 4 different buffet areas, and of course the view was great. It was definitely a treat."
Inparadise,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,Family,"The previous for us was eating lunch, this time we make our reservation two months before over the phone and we finally succeeded. The food remains their standard and no big difference between day and night, the main reason for the night was you can non stop eating for four hours starting from 5:30pm. The congee and the sushi bar still my favorite, and if the food in teppanyaki can remain hot when serving the customers will be much better."
Inparadise,2019-11-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,"This place was fabulous, the views, food and service. Located on the 46th floor, every table had a exceptional view of Taipei. The food was a real delight from the fresh seafood to the duck. I'll be going back to this place again!"
Inparadise,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,Solo,One of the nicest place to eat in Taiwan. I enjoyed the many choices of fresh seafood. I normally don’t like buffet but this place was an exception. The reason being of all the exotic seafoods. For 100 bucks a person it sure was worth the value.
Inparadise,2019-11-01T00:00:00Z,Friends,"Our daughter-in-law invited us to have buffet lunch. The restaurant is situated on the 46th floor with a 360 degree panoramic view of Taipei. It has a capacity to accommodate a few hundred patronage. Despite that you had better make a booking beforehand as very often you will miss out by its full-house situation. Foods are splendid and fantastic. They range from very fresh seafoods of various kind from king prawns, fresh raw fish, crabs, and abalone in the seafood section! Oriental foods such as Japanese sushi and tampura ring the changes of your appeitite on the other end of list. Carvery is good too with steaks, pork, lamb and different kinds of hams. There are many types of dishes suitable for vegetarians and vegan options, and exotic ones such as real bee honey hives is among the display of various types of desserts! Drinks are plentiful and being served with assorted cocktails, beers, freshly brewed coffee and tea. Lunch buffet starts at 11.30am and finishes at 2.00pm. The time we went the restaurant offers special at NT$1200 per person! It was an excellent occasion to dine along with our in-laws from Taipei and a glimpse of the panormaic 360 degree view of Taipei from the 46th floor. It was a very good occasion for family gathering!"

Thai Bazaar,2024-05-01T00:00:00Z,Couples,"Modern Thai restaurant in a shopping center. Green curry was decent, but Pad Thai lacked authentic flavor and was too salty. Food arrived very fast, but the restaurant was noisy and the cleaning station in the center was distracting."
